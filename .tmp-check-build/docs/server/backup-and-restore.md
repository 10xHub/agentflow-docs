## What is durable and what is not

10xGraph persists agent conversations and execution state across two storage layers, each serving a different purpose. Understanding what each holds and which backups to keep is essential for disaster recovery.

| Layer | Contents | Durable | Back up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Postgres** | Threads, state, messages, tool-execution ledger, schema version | Yes | **Yes** |
| **Redis** | Hot cache of recent state, default TTL 24h | No | No |
| **Vector store** (Qdrant, Mem0) | Long-term memories | Yes, in that system | Yes, with that system's own tooling |
| **Media store** | Uploaded files | Depends on backend | Yes, if local disk |

## The cache and the version guard

Redis is a read-through cache in front of Postgres, not a second source of truth. It holds the most recent state for each thread and expires entries after 24 hours by default. If Redis disappears, the next read refills it from Postgres: no data loss, only latency.

However, restoring Postgres from an older snapshot while Redis is still running can corrupt state. Here is why:

When a graph runs, it loads state from the cache (which hits Postgres if the cache misses). Each state has a version number that increases monotonically per thread. If a newer state was cached but you restore Postgres to an older point, the cache now holds versions the database has never seen.

The next worker processes a message, reads the newer version from the cache, and tries to write it back to Postgres with optimistic concurrency control (a compare-and-swap). The database rejects it because it already has a row with that version. The state becomes wedged: every write fails with `StaleStateError` until the cache entry expires 24 hours later.

Always flush Redis before restoring:

```bash
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" FLUSHDB
```

## Tables and schema

10xGraph stores all data in five tables owned by `PgCheckpointer`. With the default `public` schema, they are:

| Table | Purpose | Key columns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `threads` | Thread metadata and ownership | `thread_id` (PK), `user_id` (indexed) |
| `states` | Serialized graph state snapshots | `thread_id`, `version` (unique together) |
| `messages` | Conversation history | `thread_id` (indexed), `thread_message_id` (PK) |
| `tool_executions` | Idempotency ledger | `(thread_id, tool_call_id)` (composite PK) |
| `schema_version` | Schema migration history | `version` (PK), `applied_at` |

The `version` column in `states` is the linchpin of optimistic concurrency control. It is a per-thread counter that increases on every state write. Any two concurrent writes to the same thread will have seen different versions as their expected baseline, so one will collide on the unique `(thread_id, version)` constraint and fail. The failing worker retries from its checkpoint.

### Schema versioning

The current schema version is **3**. If you pass a custom `schema=` to `PgCheckpointer`, the tables are schema-qualified (e.g., `myschema.threads`), and your backup must target that schema:

```bash
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" --format=custom \
  --schema myschema --exclude-schema public \
  --file=custom-schema.dump
```

Schema migrations apply automatically on the first startup of an upgraded server. Always back up before upgrading so you can roll back if a migration causes problems.

### User isolation

Each row in `threads`, `states`, and `messages` carries a `user_id` column. By default, `PgCheckpointer` enforces user isolation: a request cannot read or delete another user's threads even if they know the `thread_id`. This is set at checkpointer creation and cannot be changed without re-initializing the database.

If you have disabled user isolation (`enforce_user_isolation=False`), the `user_id` column still exists but is ignored for access control. Backup and restore procedures are unaffected; only the deletion query below changes.

## Back up

### Routine backups

Take full backups regularly using the custom format, which supports parallel restore and per-table restoration:

```bash
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" \
  --format=custom \
  --file="10xgraph-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).dump"
```

If your database is shared with other applications, back up only the tables 10xGraph owns to avoid unnecessary data:

```bash
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" --format=custom \
  --table=threads \
  --table=states \
  --table=messages \
  --table=tool_executions \
  --table=schema_version \
  --file=10xgraph-tables-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).dump
```

Always verify a backup is readable before you trust it:

```bash
pg_restore --list 10xgraph-tables.dump | head
```

A backup you have never restored is a hypothesis, not a recovery plan.

### Before a release upgrade

Always back up before applying a schema migration. Migrations run automatically on the first startup of a new version:

```bash
# Full dump before upgrading
pg_dump "$DATABASE_URL" --format=custom > 10xgraph-pre-upgrade.dump

# Then upgrade your server
pip install 10xgraph[pg_checkpoint] --upgrade
10xgraph api
```

If something goes wrong during migration, you can restore from the pre-upgrade dump. See [upgrading to 1.0](/docs/project/upgrade-to-1.0) for migration details.

### Automate with your platform

Whatever recovery mechanism your platform offers is usually better than cron on a single box:

- **Cloud managed Postgres:** point-in-time recovery, automated backups, cross-region replication
- **Kubernetes:** a sidecar CronJob that runs `pg_dump`, or rely on your managed database
- **VPS:** `pg_dump` to object storage (S3, GCS) on a schedule

What matters is knowing your recovery point objective (RPO) and having tested a restore against it.

## Restore

### Full restoration

Restoring production data under live traffic corrupts state. Ensure all workers are stopped before you restore.

Running workers hold state versions in memory. If you restore Postgres to a point before those versions were written, the next write will fail the optimistic concurrency check and wedge. Worse, if Redis still holds the newer versions, workers will retry forever.

This is the safe restore procedure:

```bash
# 1. Stop all traffic. Scale workers to zero instead of draining gracefully.
kubectl scale deployment/my-agent --replicas=0

# 2. Flush the Redis cache so it cannot serve stale versions.
redis-cli -u "$REDIS_URL" FLUSHDB

# 3. Restore the dump.
pg_restore --clean --if-exists --no-owner \
  --dbname "$DATABASE_URL" 10xgraph-tables.dump

# 4. Verify the schema version matches the code you are running.
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT version FROM schema_version ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1;"

# 5. Bring up one worker and smoke-test an existing thread.
kubectl scale deployment/my-agent --replicas=1
# Test: invoke an existing thread and confirm it continues the conversation

# 6. Scale up once confident.
kubectl scale deployment/my-agent --replicas=3
```

The `--clean` flag drops tables before restoring, preventing primary key collisions if you restore over partial data. `--if-exists` suppresses errors if tables do not exist yet (safe idempotency).

### Restore a single thread

Full restores are often overkill. To recover a single conversation from a backup:

1. Restore the dump into a scratch database:

```bash
createdb 10xgraph_scratch
pg_restore --no-owner --dbname 10xgraph_scratch 10xgraph-tables.dump
```

2. Export the thread and its history to CSV:

```sql
-- From the scratch database
\copy (SELECT * FROM threads WHERE thread_id = 'thr_abc123') TO 'threads.csv' CSV HEADER
\copy (SELECT * FROM states WHERE thread_id = 'thr_abc123') TO 'states.csv' CSV HEADER
\copy (SELECT * FROM messages WHERE thread_id = 'thr_abc123') TO 'messages.csv' CSV HEADER
```

3. Import into production, **only if the thread is not currently running**:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" <<EOF
-- Import from the CSV files
\copy threads FROM 'threads.csv' CSV HEADER
\copy states FROM 'states.csv' CSV HEADER
\copy messages FROM 'messages.csv' CSV HEADER
EOF
```

Keep the `version` column intact. Editing or rewriting it defeats the concurrency guard and can cause future writes to fail mysteriously. If you must restore a specific version, use `UPDATE` and ensure the new version is higher than any version in production for that thread.

## Retention and data deletion

### Delete a user's data

Threads carry a `user_id` field indicating the owner. To honor a deletion request, remove all rows across the four tables:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM tool_executions 
  WHERE thread_id IN (
    SELECT thread_id FROM threads WHERE user_id = $1
  );
DELETE FROM messages 
  WHERE thread_id IN (
    SELECT thread_id FROM threads WHERE user_id = $1
  );
DELETE FROM states 
  WHERE thread_id IN (
    SELECT thread_id FROM threads WHERE user_id = $1
  );
DELETE FROM threads WHERE user_id = $1;
COMMIT;
```

Then handle related data outside Postgres:

1. **Redis:** Invalidate the cache for affected threads (10xGraph does this automatically on deletion).
2. **Vector store:** Delete the user's memories from Qdrant or Mem0 using that system's API.
3. **Media store:** Delete uploaded files from cloud storage or local disk.

These deletions are not transactional with Postgres, so implement a retry strategy for media deletion.

### State history pruning

By default, `PgCheckpointer` keeps the 20 most recent state snapshots per thread and deletes older ones on write. This is the `state_history_limit` parameter. Older snapshots are dropped to prevent unbounded table growth but kept long enough for typical retries and concurrency conflicts.

To change the limit (e.g., keep 50 states):

```python
checkpointer = PgCheckpointer(
    postgres_dsn="postgresql://...",
    redis_url="redis://...",
    state_history_limit=50
)
```

Large state_history_limit values trade storage for more history available during retries. The table will grow proportionally.

## Test your restore

A restoration procedure you have never tested is a hope, not a plan. Test at least once per quarter or before any major release.

1. Restore the latest backup into a scratch database (not production).
2. Point a staging server at the scratch database.
3. Invoke an existing thread and send a follow-up message.
4. Verify the response includes context from before the restore (the model references earlier messages).

If step 4 fails, your backup is incomplete. Usually, the `messages` table was excluded from a table-scoped dump.

Example test command:

```bash
# Restore to scratch
createdb 10xgraph_test
pg_restore --no-owner --dbname 10xgraph_test 10xgraph-tables.dump

# Update your test config
TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://localhost/10xgraph_test"

# Invoke an existing thread
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/graph/invoke \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TEST_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Continue the conversation"}]},
    "config": {"thread_id": "thr_existing_id"}
  }'

# Confirm the response includes old context
```

## Frequently asked questions

### What happens if I restore an old Postgres backup with Redis still running?

If Redis holds newer state versions than Postgres, running workers will see the cache version mismatch the database and fail optimistic concurrency checks, wedging threads until the cache expires. Flush Redis before restoring.

### Can I restore a single thread without a full restore?

Yes. Restore the dump into a scratch database, then copy that thread's rows from the four tables into production using SQL.

### How often should I test my restore process?

At least quarterly, or before any schema-changing release. A backup you have never restored is a hypothesis, not a recovery plan.
