# API reference

> Reference for 10xGraph: the Python library, the REST and WebSocket API, the CLI and 10xgraph.json configuration, and the typed TypeScript client.

The 10xGraph reference documents four surfaces of one system: the Python library, the REST and WebSocket API that the server generates from your graph, the CLI with its `10xgraph.json` configuration, and the TypeScript client. It is for developers who already know what they want to call and need exact signatures, options and error conditions. Pick the surface you are calling from.

## Start here

Python developers should open [Graph](/docs/reference/python/graph) and [Agent](/docs/reference/python/agent) first: they define `StateGraph`, `CompiledGraph`, `invoke`, `stream` and how a model is wired into a node. [Checkpointers](/docs/reference/python/checkpointers) matters for production, because durable threads and replay-safe tool calls depend on one.

If you run the server, the [CLI commands](/docs/reference/api-cli/commands) and [configuration](/docs/reference/api-cli/configuration) pages cover every `10xgraph.json` key, with [auth](/docs/reference/api-cli/auth) and [rate limiting](/docs/reference/api-cli/rate-limiting) for the production settings. Frontend developers should start with the [client](/docs/reference/client/client) and [stream](/docs/reference/client/stream) pages. The REST contract starts at [conventions](/docs/reference/rest-api/conventions) and the [graph endpoints](/docs/reference/rest-api/graph).

If you do not yet know which call you need, the [guides](/docs/guides) are organized by task.

## Python library

The graph engine, agents, tools, state, storage, and the evaluation harness. Everything importable from `tenxgraph.*`. The `agentflow` import is a deprecated alias until version 2.0; use `tenxgraph` in new code. The A2A protocol bridge is not available yet.

## REST and WebSocket API

What the API server exposes once you run `10xgraph api`.

The server generates its own OpenAPI schema, so the authoritative contract for your build is always available locally:

| Surface | Default path | Setting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Swagger UI | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` | `DOCS_PATH` |
| ReDoc | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redocs` | `REDOCS_PATH` |
| OpenAPI JSON | `http://127.0.0.1:8000/openapi.json` | On while either `DOCS_PATH` or `REDOCS_PATH` is set |

Set both `DOCS_PATH` and `REDOCS_PATH` to empty values in production to turn off the interactive docs and the raw schema at `/openapi.json`.

## Conventions used here

- Signatures are the real ones. If a page and the source disagree, the source is right and the page is a bug. Please [report it](/docs/project/support).
- Defaults are stated explicitly, including when the default is `None`.
- Error codes are listed with the condition that raises them. The full index is in [error codes](/docs/reference/error-codes).

Reference pages describe what things *are*. For task-shaped questions, start from the [guides](/docs/guides).
