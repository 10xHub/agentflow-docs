**The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that lets AI agents connect to external tools and data sources, such as files, databases and APIs, through a common client-server interface.** Instead of writing a custom integration for every tool, you connect to any MCP-compatible server with one protocol.

MCP was released as an open standard in November 2024 and has been adopted across the AI agent ecosystem, including support in 10xGraph, LangGraph, Claude Desktop, and major IDEs.

## The problem MCP solves

Before MCP, connecting an agent to a tool meant:

1. Writing a Python wrapper function for each external service
2. Handling authentication and serialization per integration
3. Rewriting integrations if you switched agent frameworks
4. No standard for discovery, agents could not find available tools dynamically

MCP standardizes all of this: an MCP server exposes tools (functions), resources (files, data), and prompts through a defined protocol. Any MCP client, including AI agents, can connect and use whatever the server exposes, without custom integration code.

## How MCP works

```
AI Agent (MCP Client)           MCP Server
        │                           │
        │─── list_tools() ─────────►│
        │◄── [tool1, tool2, ...]────│
        │                           │
        │─── call_tool(name, args) ─►│
        │◄── tool result ───────────│
```

The agent connects to the MCP server, discovers available tools, and calls them. The server handles the actual execution, calling an API, reading a file, querying a database.

## Using MCP tools in 10xGraph

10xGraph speaks MCP through the [`fastmcp`](https://gofastmcp.com) client. Install the extra with `pip install "10xgraph[mcp]"`, build a `Client`, and hand it to the node that owns tools:

```python
from fastmcp import Client
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import ReactAgent

# Connect to an MCP server. A command string starts it over stdio;
# a URL connects to a running HTTP server.
mcp_client = Client("python -m mcp_filesystem_server /data")

agent = ReactAgent(
    model="google/gemini-2.5-flash",
    tools=[],                 # local Python tools, if any
    client=mcp_client,        # MCP tools are discovered on top of them
    system_prompt=[{"role": "system", "content": "You can read files. Help the user."}],
)

app = agent.compile()
```

For a hand-built graph, the client goes on the `ToolNode` instead:

```python
from tenxgraph.core.graph import ToolNode

tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[], client=mcp_client)
```

Either way, the tool list is fetched from the MCP server before each LLM call, so tools added on the server show up without restarting the agent.

## Running your own MCP server

10xGraph does not ship its own MCP server implementation. Write the server with `fastmcp` (the same package the client side uses) and point a 10xGraph `Client` at it:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP(name="my-tools")

@mcp.tool()
def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    """Read a file at the given path."""
    with open(path) as f:
        return f.read()

@mcp.tool()
def list_files(directory: str) -> list[str]:
    """List files in a directory."""
    import os
    return os.listdir(directory)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

Any MCP client, another agent, Claude Desktop, VS Code, can now call your tools through the standard protocol.

## MCP vs custom tool functions

| | Custom Python function | MCP tool |
|--|----------------------|---------|
| Framework dependency | Yes, Python only | No, any MCP client |
| Discovery | Manual | Automatic via list_tools() |
| Multi-language | No | Yes, server can be any language |
| Reusability | One agent/framework | Any MCP client |
| Setup | None | Requires MCP server process |

For tools only used by one Python agent, a plain function is simpler. MCP is the right choice when you want to share tools across multiple agents, frameworks, or applications.

## MCP transports

MCP supports these transports:

- **stdio**: the agent launches the MCP server as a subprocess and communicates over stdin/stdout. Best for local tools.
- **HTTP (streamable HTTP, or SSE on older servers)**: the agent connects to a running server. Best for remote tools, services, or tools that need to stay running.

The `fastmcp` `Client` picks the transport from what you pass it:

```python
from fastmcp import Client

# stdio transport: the command string is launched as a subprocess
client = Client("node my-server.js")

# HTTP transport: point at a running server
client = Client("http://localhost:3000/mcp")

# Several servers at once, with per-server headers
client = Client({
    "mcpServers": {
        "github": {
            "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
            "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ..."},
            "transport": "streamable-http",
        },
    }
})
```

## Frequently asked questions

### Who created the Model Context Protocol?

MCP was created by Anthropic and released as an open standard in November 2024. It has since been adopted by many AI frameworks and tools, including 10xGraph, LangGraph, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot.

### Do I need MCP to give my agent tools?

No. You can give your agent plain Python functions as tools. This is simpler and requires no MCP server. MCP is useful when you want to share tools across multiple agents, use tools from another language or service, or adopt the growing ecosystem of pre-built MCP servers for common services (GitHub, Slack, databases).

### Is MCP the same as function calling?

No. Function calling is the LLM mechanism for requesting tool execution: the LLM returns a structured response naming a function and its arguments. MCP is the transport and discovery protocol for how the agent finds and calls those functions. MCP sits on top of function calling: the LLM still uses function calling, but the available functions come from MCP servers.

### What MCP servers are available?

The MCP ecosystem includes official servers from Anthropic (filesystem, web search, memory) and a growing community registry. Major services like GitHub, Google Drive, Slack, and PostgreSQL have published MCP servers. You connect any of them to 10xGraph by pointing a `fastmcp` `Client` at the server.

### Can I filter which MCP tools are available to an agent?

Yes. MCP servers can tag their tools, and the `tools_tags` option on the agent limits the agent to tools with those tags. This is useful when a server exposes many tools but you only want the agent to use a subset.
