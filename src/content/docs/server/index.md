The `10xgraph api` command starts a FastAPI server that exposes your compiled graph as a production-ready REST and WebSocket API, handling graph invocation, streaming, thread state, media files, authentication, rate limiting, and observability. This section is the single source of truth for operating the 10xGraph API server.

## What the server does

Running `10xgraph api` (or `10xgraph play` for local development) starts a Uvicorn ASGI server on port 8000 that exposes your compiled graph alongside infrastructure for real applications: stateful thread management, semantic memory, multimodal file handling, JWT or custom authentication, rate limiting, and structured logging and tracing. The server reads two inputs: your `10xgraph.json` configuration file (which graph to load, which auth backend, storage layer) and environment variables for secrets and runtime tunables. Your graph logic stays in Python; the server handles the transport layer, persistence, and cross-cutting concerns.

The server is mode-aware: development mode (`MODE=development`, the default) mounts the unauthenticated eval endpoints and leaves CORS open; production mode (`MODE=production`) does not mount them, refuses wildcard CORS with credentials, turns off the `/docs` and `/redocs` pages unless you set their paths, and defaults to ownership-based thread isolation. A single codebase switches between modes via environment variables, so your Docker image works in both dev and production.

## API routes by function

The server organizes its endpoints into logical groups. Here is the complete route map:

| Group | Prefix | Auth required | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Health** | `/ping` | No | Unauthenticated health check; returns `200 OK` if the server is ready. Used by load balancers and orchestrators to route traffic. |
| **Graph** | `/v1/graph/*` | Yes | Invoke and stream the graph (`invoke`, `stream`), read its structure (`GET /v1/graph`, `GET /v1/graph/tools`), manage runs (`stop`, `fix`), and read the state schema (`GET /v1/graph:StateSchema`). Streaming returns NDJSON (one event per line). |
| **Threads** | `/v1/threads/*` | Yes | Manage thread state and history: list threads, read and update thread state, add, list, update and delete messages, and delete threads. Requires a checkpointer; without one, threads are not persisted. |
| **Store** | `/v1/store/*` | Yes | Semantic memory CRUD and search: save memories, list and retrieve them, forget specific entries, and search across all stored memories. Requires a store backend; see [Use memory store](/docs/guides/use-memory-store). |
| **WebSocket** | `/v1/graph/ws`, `/v1/graph/live` | Yes | Two WebSocket endpoints for streaming: `/ws` for traditional streaming (events as JSON frames), `/live` for realtime audio and bidirectional messaging. Choose based on your transport needs. |
| **AG-UI** | `/v1/ag-ui` | Yes | Run the graph over the AG-UI protocol for CopilotKit and other AG-UI-compatible clients. Off by default; enable with `ag_ui.enabled: true` in `10xgraph.json`. Requires the `ag-ui` SDK extra. |
| **Media/Files** | `/v1/files/*` | Yes | Upload, retrieve, and introspect multimodal files (images, audio, documents): `POST /v1/files/upload`, `GET /v1/files/{id}`, `GET /v1/files/{id}/info`, and `GET /v1/files/{id}/url` for signed URLs. |
| **Config** | `/v1/config/multimodal` | Yes | Read the server's multimodal configuration (supported MIME types, size limits, extraction settings). |
| **Observability** | `/v1/observability/{thread_id}` | Yes | Retrieve a reconstructed run trace for a thread (spans, events, token usage). Development only: returns empty in `MODE=production`. |
| **Evals** | `/v1/evals/*` | No | List and inspect eval runs from `eval_reports/` (`GET /v1/evals/runs`, `GET /v1/evals/runs/{run_id}`), as written by `10xgraph eval`. Unauthenticated for convenience during development. **Not mounted in production mode** (`MODE=production` disables this endpoint for security). |

For detailed route signatures and response shapes, see the [REST API reference](/docs/reference/rest-api/conventions).

## Authentication and authorization

All endpoints except `/ping` and `/v1/evals` (in development) enforce an auth + authorization layer. Your choice at configuration time determines what credentials are required:

- **No auth** (`"auth": null` in `10xgraph.json`): All authenticated endpoints allow any request. Safe for internal networks or local development behind a firewall.
- **JWT** (`"auth": "jwt"`): Bearer token checked against a shared secret (`JWT_SECRET_KEY`). Standard, stateless, and suitable for mobile and SPAs.
- **Custom** (`"auth": {"method": "custom", "path": "module:attr"}`): Your own `BaseAuth` subclass; route requests to any identity provider (LDAP, OAuth2, SAML, API key validation).

Authorization (per-resource access control) is separate and optional:

- **Ownership** (default in production): A user can access only threads they created. Enforced on every thread operation (invoke, stream, read state, delete).
- **RBAC** (role-based access control): Custom `AuthorizationBackend` subclass for per-tool access, team scopes, or resource-level rules.
- **Allow all** (default in development): All authenticated users can access all resources.

WebSocket and HTTP endpoints both enforce authentication via the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. WebSocket also accepts the token in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header as `10xgraph-bearer, <token>` (the deprecated `agentflow-bearer` name still works), or as a `?token=` query parameter as a last resort. See [Secure your server](/docs/server/auth) for setup and examples.

## Development vs. production modes

The `MODE` environment variable switches the server's security and logging posture:

- **`MODE=development`** (default): Unauthenticated `/ping` and `/v1/evals` accessible, `ORIGINS="*"` (CORS allows any domain), `IS_DEBUG` defaults to true. Use for local development and testing.
- **`MODE=production`**: Only `/ping` is unauthenticated, the `/v1/evals` endpoints are not mounted, wildcard CORS with credentials is refused (set `ORIGINS` explicitly), and `/docs` and `/redocs` are disabled unless you set `DOCS_PATH` and `REDOCS_PATH`. Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options and others) are on in every mode unless `SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=false`. Use for deployments exposed to the internet.

Together with `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (a strong, randomly generated secret in production) and an explicit `ORIGINS` list, production mode refuses to start with wildcard CORS and credentials enabled, so set `ORIGINS` to your real domains.
