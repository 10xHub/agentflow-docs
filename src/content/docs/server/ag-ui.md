faq:
  - q: "Do I need AG-UI to build a frontend for 10xGraph?"
    a: "No. The TypeScript client over /v1/graph/stream is the standard path. Use AG-UI when your frontend already speaks it, such as CopilotKit."
  - q: "Why does POST /v1/ag-ui return 404?"
    a: "The endpoint is off by default. Enable it by setting ag_ui in 10xgraph.json with enabled true, install the ag-ui extra, and restart."

AG-UI is an open event protocol that connects agent backends to chat frontends. The 10xGraph API server can speak AG-UI to serve agents over `/v1/ag-ui`, enabling frontends like CopilotKit that already understand the protocol. If you are building a custom frontend, the [TypeScript client](/docs/client) over `/v1/graph/stream` is the direct path. This guide covers the server side of AG-UI. For frontend integration with CopilotKit, see [10xGraph with CopilotKit](/docs/integrations/copilotkit). For complete endpoint and event documentation, see the [AG-UI endpoint reference](/docs/reference/rest-api/ag-ui).

## Prerequisites

You need the `ag-ui` extra for the API server, a 10xGraph compiled graph, and a frontend built for AG-UI (such as CopilotKit). If you are writing a custom frontend, the [TypeScript client](/docs/client) over `/v1/graph/stream` is simpler and requires no extra package.

## Install the AG-UI extra

The endpoint is not built by default. Install it with the `ag-ui` extra:

```bash
pip install "10xgraph-api[ag-ui]"
```

## Enable the endpoint in 10xgraph.json

Add the `ag_ui` key to your `10xgraph.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph.agent:app",
  "ag_ui": { "enabled": true }
}
```

Then start the server:

```bash
10xgraph api
```

The endpoint `POST /v1/ag-ui` is now ready and appears in Swagger at `/docs` under the **AG-UI** tag. If you enable AG-UI without installing the extra, the server exits at startup and prints the install command.

## Test the endpoint

Use curl to verify the endpoint is working. The request must include `threadId`, `runId`, and `messages`:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/ag-ui \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "threadId": "t1",
    "runId": "r1",
    "messages": [{"id": "u1", "role": "user", "content": "hello"}]
  }'
```

You should see server-sent event (SSE) lines starting with `data: `, beginning with `RUN_STARTED` and ending with `RUN_FINISHED`. The output is in AG-UI event format.

If you have authentication enabled, add the authorization header:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/ag-ui \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"threadId": "t1", "runId": "r1", "messages": [{"id": "u1", "role": "user", "content": "hello"}]}'
```

| Response | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `data: {"type": "RUN_STARTED"...` followed by events and `data: {"type": "RUN_FINISHED"...` | Endpoint is working |
| `404` | AG-UI is not enabled in 10xgraph.json, or the server was not restarted |
| `401` or `403` | Authentication is required and the token is missing, invalid, or not authorized for this thread |
| `422` | The request body is invalid. Check that `threadId`, `runId`, and `messages` are present and properly formatted |
| `data: {"type": "RUN_ERROR"...` in the stream | The run started but encountered an error. Check the server logs for details |

## Connect your frontend

Point your AG-UI client to the endpoint. With CopilotKit, you create an `HttpAgent` in a Next.js route handler on the server side, so the browser never sees the API token:

```ts
import { HttpAgent } from "@ag-ui/client";

const agent = new HttpAgent({
  url: process.env.TENXGRAPH_API_URL + "/v1/ag-ui",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.TENXGRAPH_API_TOKEN}` },
});
```

By handling the connection on your server, the token stays server-side and you do not need to configure CORS for the frontend's origin. The full Next.js route handler and page component are documented in [10xGraph with CopilotKit](/docs/integrations/copilotkit).

## Configure for production

The AG-UI endpoint is mounted whenever enabled, regardless of `MODE`. Treat it with the same care as `/v1/graph/stream`. The following checklist ensures security, durability, and performance:

### Persistent checkpointing

AG-UI clients identify the conversation by `threadId`, which the server maps to a 10xGraph thread. The server reads the checkpoint to determine which messages are new and only sends those to the graph. With an in-memory checkpointer:

- Threads are lost when the server restarts
- State is not shared across replicas
- The feature appears broken in production

Use a persistent checkpointer (Postgres or SQLite). See [Set up checkpointing](/docs/guides/set-up-checkpointing) for configuration.

### Authentication and authorization

Without authentication, anyone can access anyone's thread. Enable auth with `"auth": "jwt"` or a custom `BaseAuth` subclass. In production, the authorization backend defaults to `ownership`, which enforces that each user can only access their own threads.

```json
{
  "auth": "jwt",
  "authorization": "ownership"
}
```

Environment: set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` to a strong random string (32+ characters).

See [Auth](/docs/server/auth) for full configuration.

### Client tools policy

By default, AG-UI clients can send tools with each request. The model is offered those tools for that run only. Client tools run in the browser, cannot overwrite server-side tools, and are size-limited. You can disable them if you only use server-side tools:

```json
{
  "ag_ui": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allow_client_tools": false
  }
}
```

With `allow_client_tools: false`, only tools declared in `remote_tools` are offered.

### Rate limiting

The AG-UI endpoint counts against the global `rate_limit` configuration like any other route. In production with multiple replicas, use the Redis backend:

```json
{
  "rate_limit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "backend": "redis",
    "requests": 100,
    "window": 60,
    "redis": {
      "url": "redis://localhost:6379/0",
      "prefix": "10xgraph:rate-limit"
    }
  }
}
```

See [Rate limiting](/docs/server/rate-limiting) for details.

### Stream buffering

The endpoint streams responses as server-sent events. Disable buffering on any reverse proxy or load balancer in front of the server:

- **nginx**: The response headers already include `X-Accel-Buffering: no` to disable nginx buffering.
- **Other proxies and load balancers**: Explicitly disable response buffering for `/v1/ag-ui`.
- **Connection timeout**: Set the idle timeout longer than your slowest graph run. A typical consumer-facing agent may take 10-30 seconds.
