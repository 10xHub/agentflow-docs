faq:
  - question: "Why does the termination grace period need to be so long?"
    answer: "Agent runs are not typical web requests. An LLM call alone can take minutes, and tools add more time. Kubernetes default 30-second termination grace period kills pods mid-run. The server uses 600 seconds for shutdown, so the termination window must exceed that."
  - question: "Do I need to scale horizontally?"
    answer: "Start with 2 replicas for redundancy. Scale up for concurrent demand. All replicas share Postgres and Redis, so scaling is straightforward. Configure your load balancer idle timeout for long streaming connections."
  - question: "What if I want to use the generated manifest as-is?"
    answer: "You must pin the container image tag and set a real CORS origin. Production mode refuses to start with wildcard CORS and credentials enabled. API keys and secrets must come from Kubernetes Secrets."

## The problem: long runs and short timeouts

A typical agent invocation chains several operations: the client calls the server, the server awaits an LLM response (up to 10 minutes for some models), the LLM might trigger tool calls, tools execute, results return to the LLM, and the response streams back to the client. The entire request can stay open for 20 minutes or more.

Kubernetes' default pod lifecycle is hostile to this. When you trigger a rolling deploy, the kubelet gives a pod 30 seconds to shut down gracefully before sending SIGKILL. If the app is still in an LLM call, the pod dies mid-request, and the client's stream breaks.

`10xgraph build --k8s` generates a manifest that fixes this: it sets the termination grace period, pre-termination delay, and probe timeouts so that in-flight runs finish normally, even during deploys.

## Generate the manifest

Create a `Dockerfile` and Kubernetes manifest in one command:

```bash
10xgraph build --k8s --service-name my-agent --port 8000
```

This produces three files:

- `Dockerfile` with a production-ready image that starts Gunicorn with a 600-second graceful timeout
- `.dockerignore`
- `k8s.yaml` containing a Deployment and a Service

The `--force` flag overwrites existing files. Do not add `--docker-compose` for an image you will run on Kubernetes: with that flag the `Dockerfile` omits its `CMD` and relies on the compose file's `command`. Generate the compose file in a separate run if you need it.

### What the generated manifest includes

The manifest is a working skeleton. It sets these values, which are easy to get wrong:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` | 660 | Exceeds the app's 600-second graceful timeout. Ensures SIGKILL does not arrive until the app has fully drained. |
| `preStop` sleep | 15 seconds | Gives the load balancer time to notice the pod is terminating and stop routing new requests. Without it, new traffic arrives while the app shuts down. |
| `readinessProbe` | 10s interval, 5s initial delay | Removes unhealthy pods from the load balancer quickly. Checked via `GET /ping`. |
| `livenessProbe` | 30s interval, 30s initial delay, 5 failures | Deliberately slack. A worker handling a long run must not be restarted. Checked via `GET /ping`. |

The readiness probe is strict (10-second intervals) because false positives only temporarily remove a pod from rotation. The liveness probe is slack (30-second intervals, 5 consecutive failures required) because a false positive kills the pod mid-run. Both hit the `/ping` endpoint, which does not require authentication.

Default resource requests and limits are also set (500m CPU and 512 Mi memory requested; 2 CPU and 2 Gi memory as limits), but you should tune these based on your agents and deployment environment.

## Customize before applying

The manifest is not production-ready as-is. You must edit these values:

```yaml
containers:
  - name: my-agent
    image: 10xgraph-api:latest        # Replace with your own pinned image reference
    env:
      - name: ORIGINS
        value: "https://your-frontend.example.com"   # Set to your actual origin
      - name: MODE
        value: "production"             # Already set, but verify
      - name: IS_DEBUG
        value: "false"                  # Already set, but verify
```

### Pin the image

The manifest uses `10xgraph-api:latest` as a placeholder image name. Build your own image from the generated `Dockerfile`, push it to your registry, and reference it immutably. A moving `latest` tag makes rollbacks ambiguous and makes image-related issues hard to debug:

- A digest: `my-registry/my-agent@sha256:abc123...`
- A version tag: `my-registry/my-agent:1.4.0`
- A git-based tag: `my-registry/my-agent:git-abc123def`

### Set CORS origins explicitly

The manifest sets `ORIGINS` to the placeholder `https://your-frontend.example.com`. Replace it with your actual frontend domain(s), comma-separated if there are multiple:

```yaml
- name: ORIGINS
  value: "https://app.example.com,https://app-staging.example.com"
```

With `MODE=production`, the server refuses to start if `ORIGINS` is the wildcard `*` while credentials are enabled, which is the default (`CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=true`). If you truly need wildcard origins, set `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=false`, which is rare.

### Mount secrets, do not bake them

API keys, database passwords, and JWT secrets must come from Kubernetes Secrets, never from plain values in the manifest or baked into the image. The generated manifest does not reference a Secret, so add an `envFrom` entry to the container yourself:

```yaml
envFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: my-agent-secrets
```

Create the secret in your cluster before deploying. The server reads `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_ALGORITHM` and `REDIS_URL` itself; names such as the Postgres DSN variable below are whatever your graph module reads when it builds the checkpointer:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic my-agent-secrets \
  --from-literal=GOOGLE_API_KEY="..." \
  --from-literal=OPENAI_API_KEY="..." \
  --from-literal=JWT_SECRET_KEY="..." \
  --from-literal=JWT_ALGORITHM="HS256" \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_DSN="postgresql://..." \
  --from-literal=REDIS_URL="redis://..."
```

Alternatively, use your favorite secrets management tool (Sealed Secrets, External Secrets, Vault, etc.) to manage these safely.

## Apply and verify

Once you have customized the manifest, apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s.yaml
```

Monitor the rollout:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/my-agent
kubectl get pods -l app=my-agent
```

Verify the service is reachable:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/my-agent 8000:80
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/ping
```

If `/ping` returns a JSON body with `"data": "pong"`, the deployment is live.

### Test graceful termination

The true test is that a long-running request survives a deploy. Start a streaming request:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Stream a request (this will take minutes)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/graph/stream \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "explain quantum physics in detail"}]}]}'
```

While that request is in flight, trigger a rolling restart in another terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 2: Rolling restart
kubectl rollout restart deployment/my-agent
```

The stream should continue and complete normally. If the connection closes or times out, one of these is true:

- `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is shorter than your longest run
- The container is not running as PID 1 and not receiving SIGTERM
- Your load balancer's idle timeout is shorter than the grace period

## Scaling horizontally

The manifest defaults to 2 replicas. Scale up for higher concurrency:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment my-agent --replicas=5
```

Before scaling, understand how 10xgraph handles distributed state:

1. **Shared checkpointer is mandatory.** All replicas must read and write to the same Postgres and Redis. If they do not, the same thread will resolve differently depending on which pod answers, causing data loss. Use `PgCheckpointer` in production (see [Set up checkpointing](/docs/guides/set-up-checkpointing)).

2. **Threads are not sticky.** State lives in the checkpointer, not in the pod. You do not need (and should not use) session affinity. A client can invoke a thread on any replica.

3. **Streaming connections are long-lived.** If your load balancer (or ingress) has an idle timeout shorter than your longest run, the connection will close mid-stream even though the pod is healthy. Set idle timeouts to at least 15 minutes. For AWS ALB/NLB, increase `deregistration_delay`. For Nginx, increase `proxy_read_timeout`.

4. **Concurrent writes conflict.** With optimistic concurrency, two overlapping writes to the same thread raise a `StaleStateError`, and the API returns 409. Clients that fan out against a single `thread_id` should retry or serialize. Most clients do not do this; it only matters if you deliberately parallelize writes to the same thread.

### Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

For autoscaling, create an HPA resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: my-agent
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-agent
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
  behavior:
    scaleDown:
      stabilizationWindowSeconds: 900  # Give long runs time to drain
```

CPU is the provided metric, but it is a poor signal for agent workloads. Agents are typically latency-bound on the model provider, not compute-bound. Scale on queue depth (requests pending in your ingress) or request concurrency (active requests per pod) instead, which your ingress or load balancer can expose.

## Troubleshooting deployments

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runs truncate on every deploy | `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` is too short, or the process is not PID 1 | Increase to 660+ seconds. Ensure your Dockerfile uses `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`, not a shell wrapper. |
| Requests fail for a few seconds after a deploy | `preStop` sleep removed or load balancer does not respect endpoint removal | Restore the `preStop` sleep in the manifest. Increase your load balancer's connection drain time. |
| Pods restart during long runs | Liveness probe is too strict (failing too quickly) | Loosen the liveness probe (`periodSeconds: 30`, `failureThreshold: 5`). The readiness probe should be strict; the liveness probe should not. |
| Thread history disappears or threads resolve differently | Replicas do not share a checkpointer | Ensure the Postgres DSN and `REDIS_URL` your graph module uses point to shared instances. Do not use `InMemoryCheckpointer` in production. |
| Random 409 errors under high load | Two requests wrote to the same thread concurrently | This is expected with optimistic concurrency. Retry with exponential backoff, or serialize writes to the same thread. |
| Server exits at startup with a CORS error | `ORIGINS` is `*` while credentials are enabled | Set `ORIGINS` to your real domain. If you need wildcard, set `CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=false` (unusual). |
| Browser requests fail CORS checks | `ORIGINS` still holds the placeholder | Set `ORIGINS` to your real domain. |
