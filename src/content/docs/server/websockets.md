10xGraph exposes two WebSocket endpoints: `/v1/graph/ws` for turn-based agent interactions and `/v1/graph/live` for realtime audio conversations. WebSockets keep a persistent connection open so the server can stream responses token-by-token, the client can resume from checkpoints, and (for realtime agents) both sides can exchange audio in near-real-time. Both endpoints support the same authentication, rate limiting, and concurrency controls as REST APIs.

## When to use WebSocket

Use WebSocket when the client needs true bidirectional streaming or low-latency two-way communication. For simple invoke-and-wait workflows, REST's `/v1/graph/invoke` is simpler. For streaming where the client reads until done, REST's `/v1/graph/stream` (NDJSON) is also sufficient and works in more environments (proxies, browsers without WebSocket support).

WebSocket shines for:

- **Resume workflows**: the client detects a remote tool call in the stream, executes it, and resumes the same run without losing context.
- **Interactive agents**: the client sends new instructions mid-run without waiting for the current response.
- **Realtime audio**: the client streams audio input while the model speaks output, with near-zero latency.
- **Long-lived connections**: applications that keep one socket open for many sequential runs over hours.

## Authentication

Both endpoints use the same credential methods as REST APIs. The bearer token can come from:

1. **`Authorization` HTTP header** (standard): `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
2. **`10xgraph-bearer` Sec-WebSocket-Protocol** (recommended for browsers): browsers cannot set an `Authorization` header on a WebSocket, and this keeps the token out of the URL
3. **`?token=` query parameter** (fallback): the token is visible in logs and browser history, so avoid in production

At the WebSocket handshake, the server verifies the token. Before every graph run on `/v1/graph/ws` (the client can send several messages on one socket), the token is verified again: if it expires or is revoked between runs, the server sends an error chunk and closes the socket with code 1008.

**Setting the subprotocol** (if using `10xgraph-bearer`): offer two subprotocols, the sentinel first and the raw token second.

```javascript
const socket = new WebSocket(
  "wss://api.example.com/v1/graph/ws",
  ["10xgraph-bearer", TOKEN]
);
```

The server accepts both `10xgraph-bearer` and the legacy `agentflow-bearer` (deprecated until 2.0), and echoes the sentinel back as the accepted subprotocol.

## Turn-based streaming: `/v1/graph/ws`

This endpoint streams graph execution as the agent runs step-by-step. The client sends one message, the server streams back chunks, and when done, the client can send another message or close the connection. It is suitable for turn-based agents (ReactAgent, PlanActReflect, etc.) where each user message is a complete turn.

### Protocol

**Fresh run (start a new thread or run on an existing one):**

```json
Client → Server:
{
  "invoke_type": "fresh",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "What is 2 + 2?"}]}
  ],
  "config": {
    "thread_id": "optional-id-or-omit-for-new-thread"
  }
}

Server → Client (StreamChunk JSON, the same format as POST /v1/graph/stream):
{"event": "updates", "data": {"status": "invoking_graph", ...}}
{"event": "message", "message": {...}}
...
{"event": "updates", "data": {"status": "done"}}
```

The final `{"event": "updates", "data": {"status": "done"}}` chunk is sent by the server after every run on the socket. The socket stays open for the next frame.

**Resume after remote tool call:**

When a run ends on a remote (client-executed) tool call, the client executes the tool (for example in the browser) and sends the result back. The server does not inspect chunks for tool calls; detecting them is the client library's job. The `resume` frame needs `tool_result` and `config.thread_id`:

```json
Client → Server:
{
  "invoke_type": "resume",
  "tool_result": [
    {"role": "tool", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "result here"}]}
  ],
  "config": {
    "thread_id": "same-thread-from-checkpoint"
  }
}

Server → Client:
(same format: StreamChunk lines, ending with updates/status:done)
```

### Thread IDs

- Omit `thread_id` or send `"new"` to create a fresh thread each time.
- Send an existing `thread_id` to resume that thread's conversation.
- A blank or missing `thread_id` also means "create a new one", so the server generates an ID.
- `resume` runs require `config.thread_id`.
- When auth is enabled, the thread is owner-checked before each run. An unauthorized thread gets an `error` chunk with `Not authorized to stream thread ...` and the socket stays open.

### Rate limiting and concurrency

Every WebSocket handshake and every graph run on the socket counts against the global rate limit: the same bucket as REST requests, when `rate_limit` is configured.

- A handshake over the limit is refused before `accept()` with close code 1013.
- A run over the limit gets an `error` chunk whose `data` has `reason` and `retry_after_seconds`. The run is skipped and the socket stays open; the check runs again on the next frame.

Connection caps apply at the handshake only: `websocket.max_connections` (per process) and `websocket.max_connections_per_user`. Over either cap, the handshake is refused with close code 1013.

## Realtime audio: `/v1/graph/live`

This endpoint bridges a WebSocket to a **realtime agent** (a graph rooted at a live agent, driven through `CompiledGraph.arealtime()`), enabling true two-way audio conversation. The client and server exchange audio frames and control messages in real-time, with minimal latency.

Realtime is only for agents built for it: connecting to `/v1/graph/ws` with a realtime agent closes immediately with code 1008 (use `/v1/graph/live` instead). The reverse also holds: a turn-based graph on `/v1/graph/live` is closed with 1008.

### Protocol

**Init frame (JSON, the first frame sent):** a flat object. All keys are optional; the keys the server reads are `thread_id`, `model`, `voice`, `modalities`, `vad`, `system_prompt` and `tools_tags`.

```json
Client → Server:
{
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash-live",
  "voice": "Puck",
  "modalities": ["AUDIO"],
  "vad": {
    "enabled": true,
    "prefix_padding_ms": 300,
    "silence_duration_ms": 1000
  },
  "thread_id": "optional-thread-id"
}
```

The `model` override is honored only if it is listed in `websocket.realtime_models`; otherwise it is ignored and the agent's own model is used. A bad value (for example an invalid `modalities` entry) returns a fatal `error` event with code `invalid_config`.

**Downstream (Server → Client):**
- **Binary frames**: PCM16 audio deltas from the model
- **JSON text frames**: every other event (transcripts, turn complete, interrupted, tool calls, errors)

**Upstream (Client → Server):**
- **Binary frames**: PCM16 audio input from the user/environment
- **JSON text frames**: `{"type": "activity_start"}`, `{"type": "activity_end"}`, `{"type": "text", "text": "..."}`, `{"type": "close"}`

Refer to the [realtime audio guide](/docs/guides/use-realtime-audio) for details and examples.

## Configuration

WebSocket behavior is controlled by keys in the `websocket` object within `10xgraph.json`:

| Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_connections` | integer, null | 1000 | Hard cap on concurrent WebSocket connections (both `/v1/graph/ws` and `/v1/graph/live`) across this process. Set to `0` or `null` for unlimited. |
| `max_connections_per_user` | integer, null | 10 | Cap on how many WebSocket connections one verified user can hold (by `user_id`). Set to `0` or `null` for unlimited. |
| `realtime_models` | array of strings | `[]` | Models a `/v1/graph/live` client is allowed to request (for example `["gemini-2.5-flash-live"]`). Empty means clients cannot override the agent's model. |

**Example:**

```json
{
  "agent": "graph:app",
  "websocket": {
    "max_connections": 5000,
    "max_connections_per_user": 50,
    "realtime_models": ["gemini-2.5-flash-live"]
  }
}
```

In a multi-worker deployment (Gunicorn + Uvicorn), these limits are **per process**, not global. Size them accordingly: if you run 4 workers with `max_connections: 1000`, the server can hold 4000 concurrent sockets total.

## Close codes

WebSocket close codes follow RFC 6455. The server sends these in specific situations:

| Code | Meaning | Retry? |
|---|---|---|
| 1000 | Normal closure (client initiated or clean shutdown) | No |
| 1003 | Unsupported data: the `/v1/graph/live` init frame is not a JSON object or could not be parsed | No |
| 1008 | Policy violation: wrong endpoint for the agent type, token expired/revoked between runs, or auth/authorization failure at the handshake | No |
| 1011 | Unexpected server error during run | May retry after brief delay |
| 1013 | Try again later: rate limit or connection cap exceeded at the handshake | Yes, after a delay |

On `/v1/graph/ws`, an `error` chunk is sent before closing for the wrong-agent-type and expired-token cases. Handshake rejections (auth failure, rate limit, connection cap) close before the socket is accepted, so no chunk is sent.

## Proxy settings

If the API server is behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, HAProxy, CloudFlare, etc.), the proxy must be configured to preserve the WebSocket connection and pass through the upgrade headers. Additionally, when authentication is enabled and the proxy forwards client IP via `X-Forwarded-For`, the server must be told to trust that header.

### Proxy compatibility

- The proxy must support HTTP/1.1 upgrade requests (WebSocket handshake).
- Connection and Upgrade headers must be forwarded as-is.
- Most reverse proxies support this by default; confirm in their documentation.

**Nginx example** (snippet):

```nginx
location /v1/graph/ws {
  proxy_pass http://backend:8000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
  proxy_read_timeout 86400s;  # Allow long-lived sockets
}
```

### Client IP detection

If you use the `trusted_proxy_headers` setting in `rate_limit`, the server reads the client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` to bucket rate limits correctly:

```json
{
  "agent": "graph:app",
  "rate_limit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "by": "ip",
    "trusted_proxy_headers": true,
    "trusted_proxy_hops": 1
  }
}
```

- **`trusted_proxy_headers`**: whether to honor `X-Forwarded-For` at all. Set `true` only if there is a proxy you control.
- **`trusted_proxy_hops`**: how many proxy layers to count back from the right of the `X-Forwarded-For` list. Set to 1 if you have one proxy, 2 for two proxies in series, etc.

Without this, clients behind a proxy appear to have the proxy's IP and all land in the same rate-limit bucket.

## Example: TypeScript client

Here's a minimal example using the 10xGraph TypeScript client:

```typescript
import { TenxGraphClient, Message } from "10xgraph-client";

const client = new TenxGraphClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
  authToken: "your-jwt-token",
});

// wsStream() has the same signature as stream(), but runs over /v1/graph/ws
const stream = client.wsStream([Message.text_message("What is 2 + 2?")], {
  config: { thread_id: "my-thread" },
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  if (chunk.event === "message") {
    console.log("Message:", chunk.message);
  }
}
```

`wsStream()` handles remote tool calls for you: it runs registered client-side tools and sends the `resume` frame on the same socket. Use `client.stream()` for the HTTP equivalent. See [Client streaming](/docs/client/stream-responses).

## Example: Raw WebSocket in JavaScript

If you prefer to manage the WebSocket directly:

```javascript
const token = "your-jwt-token";
const socket = new WebSocket("wss://api.example.com/v1/graph/ws", ["10xgraph-bearer", token]);

socket.onopen = () => {
  console.log("Connected");
  socket.send(JSON.stringify({
    invoke_type: "fresh",
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: [{ type: "text", text: "Hello" }] }
    ]
  }));
};

socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  const chunk = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log("Chunk:", chunk.event, chunk.data);

  if (chunk.event === "updates" && chunk.data.status === "done") {
    // Run finished
    socket.close(1000);
  }
};

socket.onerror = (event) => {
  console.error("WebSocket error:", event);
};

socket.onclose = (event) => {
  console.log(`Closed: code=${event.code}, reason=${event.reason}`);
};
```

## Troubleshooting

**Connection refused or 403 forbidden**
- Check that your token is valid and not expired. Verify it is passed via the `Authorization` header, the `10xgraph-bearer` subprotocol, or `?token=` query. A rejected handshake closes with code 1008.
- Confirm authentication is enabled and configured in `10xgraph.json` (`"auth": "jwt"` or custom).

**Socket closes with code 1008**
- If the message is "This graph is a live agent...", you're using `/v1/graph/ws` on a realtime agent. Switch to `/v1/graph/live`.
- If the message is "Session expired...", your token has expired. Reconnect with a fresh token.

**Socket closes with code 1013**
- Rate limit or connection cap exceeded at the handshake. Wait and reconnect.
- Check `websocket.max_connections` and `websocket.max_connections_per_user` in your config.

**Proxy forwarding issues**
- Confirm the proxy forwards the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers. Most proxies do by default.
- If behind a proxy, set `trusted_proxy_headers: true` in rate_limit config so the server reads the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For`.
- Increase proxy timeouts: WebSocket connections can be long-lived, so set read/write timeouts to several minutes or higher.

**Audio glitches or delays on `/v1/graph/live`**
- Increase `vad.prefix_padding_ms` to keep more audio from before speech is detected.
- Tune `start_sensitivity` and `end_sensitivity` in the `vad` object if speech is missed or background noise triggers it.
- Check network latency; realtime is sensitive to round-trip time.
