description: Install 10xGraph and the API server with pip on Python 3.12 or newer, add provider extras and a checkpointer, verify the CLI, and install the TypeScript client.
section: "Get started"
order: 30
updated: "2026-10-08"
faq:
  - q: "Which Python version does 10xGraph need?"
    a: "Python 3.12 or newer. Both the core package and the API package declare requires-python >=3.12, so pip refuses to install them on an older interpreter."
  - q: "Do I need to install a provider extra?"
    a: "Yes, for the provider you use. The base 10xgraph install does not include the OpenAI, Google GenAI, or Anthropic SDKs; install the matching extra (e.g., pip install \"10xgraph[openai]\") and set that provider's API key in an environment variable."
  - q: "Which extra do I need to run in production?"
    a: "Add pg_checkpoint, which brings in asyncpg and redis for PgCheckpointer. Use a durable checkpointer in production so conversation state survives process restarts."
  - q: "Is the Python import name different from the package name?"
    a: "Yes. Install 10xgraph from PyPI, but import from tenxgraph (e.g., from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import ReactAgent). The agentflow import alias still works until 2.0 but is deprecated."

Install 10xGraph with `pip install 10xgraph` on Python 3.12 or newer, adding the extra for your model provider, then add `10xgraph-api` for the server and CLI. Import the library as `tenxgraph`. This page also covers optional extras, API keys, verifying the install, and the TypeScript client.

## What are the requirements?

Start with Python 3.12 or newer and a package manager like pip or uv. You also need an API key from the LLM provider you plan to use, and PostgreSQL and Redis if you deploy to production.

| Requirement | What it is | When you need it |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.12 or newer | Always, for the core framework and API server |
| Node.js | 18 or newer | Only if building a TypeScript or JavaScript client application |
| LLM API key | OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic | Always, to call a model from your agent |
| PostgreSQL and Redis | For durable state | Production only; development uses in-memory state |
| Virtual environment | venv or uv | Recommended; keeps dependencies isolated |

## How do I install the Python packages?

Install `10xgraph` (the core framework) and `10xgraph-api` (the API server and CLI) in a Python virtual environment. A virtual environment ensures the `10xgraph` command and the libraries come from the same Python interpreter, avoiding version conflicts.

Create the environment and activate it. With `pip`:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install 10xgraph 10xgraph-api
```

Or with `uv` (faster):

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install 10xgraph 10xgraph-api
```

`10xgraph` is the core orchestration engine. `10xgraph-api` adds a FastAPI server, a command-line tool, and a development playground.

### Upgrading from the old names?

If you previously installed `10xscale-agentflow` or `10xscale-agentflow-cli`, uninstall them first because the new packages also ship an `agentflow` alias module:

```bash
pip uninstall 10xscale-agentflow-cli 10xscale-agentflow
pip install 10xgraph 10xgraph-api
```

Keeping both sets installed can leave you importing the wrong copy.

## Which provider extra should I install?

10xGraph does not include LLM provider SDKs by default. You must install the extra for the provider you use. Choose one based on which model you want to call:

| Provider | Extra | SDK it installs |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | `openai` | `openai` |
| Google GenAI | `google-genai` | `google-genai` |
| Anthropic | `anthropic` | `anthropic` (1.x) |
| Anthropic via Vertex AI | `anthropic-vertex` | `anthropic[vertex]` |
| Anthropic via Bedrock | `anthropic-bedrock` | `anthropic[bedrock]` |

Install the extra in the same pip command or add it later:

```bash
pip install "10xgraph[openai]" 10xgraph-api
```

Combine extras with commas if you need more than one (here OpenAI, a Postgres and Redis checkpointer, and MCP tools):

```bash
pip install "10xgraph[openai,pg_checkpoint,mcp]" 10xgraph-api
```

### Other optional extras

Beyond model providers, optional extras unlock advanced features:

| Extra | Includes | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `pg_checkpoint` | asyncpg, redis (production durable state) | Production deployments with durable state |
| `mcp` | fastmcp, mcp | Tools served by Model Context Protocol servers |
| `sqlite_checkpoint` | aiosqlite | Single-machine persistence without PostgreSQL or Redis |
| `qdrant` | qdrant-client | Long-term semantic memory and retrieval |
| `mem0` | mem0ai | Managed vector memory store |
| `kafka` | aiokafka | Stream execution events to Apache Kafka |
| `rabbitmq` | aio-pika | Stream execution events to RabbitMQ |
| `redis` | redis | Streaming and pub/sub without the checkpointer |
| `otel` | opentelemetry-api, opentelemetry-sdk | Traces, metrics, and logs to observability backends |
| `logfire` | logfire | Send traces to Logfire |
| `images` | Pillow | Image handling in multimodal messages |
| `langsmith` | langsmith | Send traces to LangSmith |

The `all` extra installs every other extra at once and is useful for local development and CI, but pin specific versions before shipping to production.

Version pinning matters: 10xGraph is pre-1.0, so minor version updates may include breaking changes. Example of a safe lock:

```bash
pip install "10xgraph==0.10.0" "10xgraph-api==0.7.0"
```

Read the `CHANGELOG.md` before upgrading.

## How do I verify the installation?

Run both commands to confirm everything is set up:

```bash
10xgraph version
python -c "import tenxgraph; print(tenxgraph.__file__)"
```

The first prints the `10xgraph-api` version and the installed core framework version. The second confirms the Python library (`tenxgraph`) is importable from your virtual environment and shows where it is installed.

Example output (the exact formatting and versions vary by release):

```text
$ 10xgraph version
10xgraph-api
  Version: 0.7.0
10xgraph (core)
  Version: 0.10.0

$ python -c "import tenxgraph; print(tenxgraph.__file__)"
/path/to/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/tenxgraph/__init__.py
```

If the `10xgraph` command is not found, make sure your virtual environment is activated. If the import fails, check that you ran `pip install` inside the activated environment. See [installation troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/installation) for help.

## How do I set LLM provider API keys?

Each provider reads its API key from an environment variable. You can export the variable in your shell session, or store it in a `.env` file that `10xgraph api` loads at startup.

Export the key in your shell:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

Or create a `.env` file in your project and point to it in `10xgraph.json`:

```json title="10xgraph.json"
{
  "agent": "graph.react:app",
  "env": ".env"
}
```

Then define the variables in `.env` (do not commit this file):

```bash title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

The variables 10xGraph recognizes are:

| Provider | Environment Variable |
|---|---|
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Google Gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` (first choice) or `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |

Never commit `.env` or API keys to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude it:

```text title=".gitignore"
.env
.env.local
```

## How do I install the TypeScript client?

If you are building a JavaScript or TypeScript application that calls the 10xGraph API server, install the client SDK:

```bash
npm install 10xgraph-client
```

The main class is `TenxGraphClient`, and the package requires Node.js 18 or newer. See the [client documentation](/docs/client) for usage.

The client talks to a running `10xgraph api` server over HTTP, and you pass a thread ID to keep conversation history across runs. Use `10xgraph-api` 0.7.0 or newer with client 0.6.0 or newer: the client authenticates WebSockets with the `10xgraph-bearer` subprotocol, which older servers do not accept. HTTP calls work with either. See the [Quickstart](/docs/get-started/first-agent) for a complete example.

## What if something goes wrong?

If installation fails or the commands do not work, check these pages:

- [Installation troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/installation): pip errors, command not found, import errors, and environment variable issues
- [Provider troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/providers): model not found, auth failures, rate limit errors for your chosen provider
- [API server troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/api-server): server startup errors and runtime issues
- [Error code reference](/docs/reference/error-codes): what each structured error code means

## Next step

Once installation is complete and verified, build your first agent in the [Quickstart](/docs/get-started/first-agent).
