These pages compare **10xGraph** with other Python agent frameworks, written by the 10xGraph team. Every claim about a competitor links to its official documentation or package metadata, and each page lists its sources with the date they were checked (2026-10-06). Each page also says where the other framework is the better choice, and where 10xGraph is weaker.

## Pick a comparison

- [**10xGraph vs LangGraph**](/docs/compare/10xgraph-vs-langgraph). Graph runtimes compared on the production layer
- [**10xGraph vs CrewAI**](/docs/compare/10xgraph-vs-crewai). Role-based crews vs typed graphs
- [**10xGraph vs AutoGen**](/docs/compare/10xgraph-vs-autogen). AutoGen (now in maintenance mode) vs 10xGraph
- [**10xGraph vs LlamaIndex Agents**](/docs/compare/10xgraph-vs-llamaindex-agents). Retrieval-first agents vs a runtime-first server
- [**10xGraph vs Google ADK**](/docs/compare/10xgraph-vs-google-adk). Google's Agent Development Kit vs 10xGraph

## What the comparisons focus on

Most agent frameworks give you a graph or a crew. The comparisons start with what happens after that, because it is where the frameworks differ most. 10xGraph generates, in the open-source install under the MIT license:

- **A production server.** REST, SSE, WebSocket and realtime-audio endpoints from the compiled graph, with JWT or custom auth, role scopes and owner-only threads
- **Rate limits and deploy files.** Memory or Redis rate limiting, and `10xgraph build --docker-compose --k8s` for Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests
- **Correct behavior under failure.** Replay-safe tool calls, versioned (compare-and-swap) state writes, and node and tool timeouts
- **A typed TypeScript client.** `@10xgraph/client` for invoking and streaming from any frontend

Table stakes such as graph orchestration, multi-provider models, MCP, streaming and checkpointing are listed at the bottom of each table, because the frameworks here have them too.

## Where to start

If you are migrating, start with [Get started](/docs/get-started). Each comparison page has a migration section that maps the other framework's concepts to 10xGraph.
