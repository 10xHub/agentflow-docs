## What the memory store solves

As your agent runs across many threads and user sessions, it accumulates conversation history in a checkpointer. But conversation history alone doesn't retain knowledge that should persist across all future interactions: user preferences, learned facts, domain expertise, or semantic relationships between entities.

The memory store is a separate, persistent vector database that holds this long-term knowledge independently of any single thread or conversation. Unlike the checkpointer (which preserves conversation history per thread), the memory store is **global**: facts written to it are accessible in future conversations with the same user, across different topics, and over weeks or months.

This guide shows you how to set up a memory store, integrate it with your agent, and use it to deliver personalized, contextually aware experiences.

## Memory store vs. checkpointer

These two components work together but serve different purposes:

| Component | Scope | Lifetime | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Checkpointer** | Per-thread | Conversation duration | Remembers conversation history within a single chat session; enables resuming interrupted runs. |
| **Memory store** | Global | Cross-thread, persistent | Stores user preferences, facts, and learned knowledge that should inform future conversations. |

Example: a customer support agent uses the checkpointer to recall "we discussed issue X earlier in this chat," and the memory store to recall "this customer always prefers phone support over email."

## Choosing a store implementation

10xGraph provides two production-ready memory store implementations. Both implement the `BaseStore` interface and work with the same `MemoryConfig` API.

### QdrantStore

**Best for:** Self-hosted or cloud vector database deployments, full control over infrastructure, hybrid retrieval strategies.

Qdrant is an open-source, high-performance vector database optimized for similarity search. You can run it locally (file-backed), self-hosted (server), or on Qdrant Cloud.

**Trade-offs:**
- More operational overhead (Qdrant server management)
- More flexible configuration (distance metrics, retrieval strategies, chunking)
- Excellent performance at scale
- No vendor lock-in

### Mem0Store

**Best for:** Managed, serverless memory experiences, minimal operations, batteries-included setup.

Mem0 is a managed memory platform that abstracts away vector database operations. It provides automatic memory consolidation, deduplication, and retrieval.

**Trade-offs:**
- Third-party dependency and service terms
- Less control over vector search internals
- Easier to start and maintain
- Built-in memory cleanup and optimization

Choose based on your infrastructure preferences. For this guide, we'll show both; they are interchangeable in your agent code.

## Setting up QdrantStore

### Install the package

```bash
pip install "10xgraph[qdrant]"
```

You also need an embedding service to convert text to vectors. Both OpenAI and Google embeddings are built in; we show OpenAI here.

### Local Qdrant (file-backed)

Best for development and single-machine deployments. No external server needed.

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import (
    QdrantStore,
    OpenAIEmbedding,
    create_local_qdrant_store,
)

# Create a local, file-backed Qdrant store
store = create_local_qdrant_store(
    path="./qdrant_data",
    embedding=OpenAIEmbedding(),  # uses OPENAI_API_KEY env var
    collection="my_agent_memory",
)

# The store is now ready to use
```

The store creates a `./qdrant_data` folder on your machine. Each collection is persisted there; when you restart your agent, the memories are still available.

### Remote Qdrant server

For a team or production environment running a shared Qdrant server.

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import (
    create_remote_qdrant_store,
    OpenAIEmbedding,
)

store = create_remote_qdrant_store(
    host="qdrant.example.com",
    port=6333,
    embedding=OpenAIEmbedding(),
    collection="my_agent_memory",
)
```

### Qdrant Cloud

For fully managed, serverless Qdrant.

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import (
    create_cloud_qdrant_store,
    GoogleEmbedding,
)

store = create_cloud_qdrant_store(
    url="https://abc123-ef45.qdrant.io",
    api_key="your-qdrant-cloud-api-key",
    embedding=GoogleEmbedding(),  # uses GOOGLE_API_KEY env var
    collection="my_agent_memory",
)
```

Get your Qdrant Cloud URL and API key from the Qdrant Cloud dashboard.

### Factory functions

The three factories above (`create_local_qdrant_store`, `create_remote_qdrant_store`, `create_cloud_qdrant_store`) all construct a `QdrantStore` internally. Use them for clarity and because they provide sensible defaults. If you need fine-grained control, construct `QdrantStore` directly:

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import (
    QdrantStore,
    OpenAIEmbedding,
    DistanceMetric,
)

store = QdrantStore(
    embedding=OpenAIEmbedding(),
    path="./qdrant_data",                      # local: provide path
    # OR:
    # host="localhost",                        # remote: provide host + port
    # port=6333,
    # OR:
    # url="https://...",                       # cloud: provide url + api_key
    # api_key="...",
    collection="my_custom_collection",
    distance_metric=DistanceMetric.COSINE,     # COSINE | EUCLIDEAN | DOT_PRODUCT | MANHATTAN
)
```

---

## Setting up Mem0Store

### Install the package

```bash
pip install "10xgraph[mem0]"
```

### Mem0 with OpenAI LLM

Mem0 uses its own configuration format to specify the LLM and vector store.

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import (
    Mem0Store,
    create_mem0_store,
)

store = create_mem0_store(
    config={
        "llm": {
            "provider": "openai",
            "config": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
        }
    },
    user_id="default_user",
    app_id="support_app",
)
```

### Mem0 backed by your own Qdrant

You can combine Mem0's memory consolidation with your own Qdrant infrastructure.

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import create_mem0_store_with_qdrant

store = create_mem0_store_with_qdrant(
    qdrant_url="https://abc123-ef45.qdrant.io",
    qdrant_api_key="your-api-key",
    collection_name="mem0_collection",
    app_id="support_app",
)
```

---

## Embedding options

Both `QdrantStore` and `Mem0Store` need an embedding function to convert text to vectors. Choose based on your API keys and preferences.

| Class | Provider | Model | Env var required |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OpenAIEmbedding` | OpenAI | `text-embedding-3-small` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `GoogleEmbedding` | Google | `text-embedding-004` | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import OpenAIEmbedding, GoogleEmbedding

openai_embed = OpenAIEmbedding()
google_embed = GoogleEmbedding()

# Then pass to your store:
# store = QdrantStore(embedding=openai_embed, path="./qdrant_data")
```

Both are equally good; OpenAI is slightly faster, Google is slightly cheaper. Both are deterministic: the same text always produces the same vector.

---

## Connecting the store to your graph

Once you've created your store, pass it to `graph.compile()`:

```python
from tenxgraph.core.graph import StateGraph, Agent

# ... build your graph ...

app = graph.compile(
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
    store=store,  # <-- pass the store here
)
```

Inside your nodes and tools, access the store via dependency injection:

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import BaseStore
from tenxgraph.utils import tool

@tool
async def my_tool(store: BaseStore):
    """Access memories within a tool."""
    results = await store.asearch("user preferences", limit=3)
    for result in results:
        print(result.content)
```

The `BaseStore` dependency is injected automatically; no manual wiring needed.

---

## Agent-level memory with MemoryConfig

For the most common case, automatically retrieving and writing user-specific memories during LLM calls, use `MemoryConfig` on the `Agent` node.

### Minimal setup

```python
from tenxgraph.core.graph import Agent
from tenxgraph.storage.store import (
    MemoryConfig,
    create_local_qdrant_store,
    OpenAIEmbedding,
)

# Create a store
store = create_local_qdrant_store("./qdrant_data", OpenAIEmbedding())

# Create an agent with memory
agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    memory=MemoryConfig(store=store),
)
```

That's it. The agent now automatically retrieves relevant memories before each LLM call and exposes memory tools to the model so it can write new memories.

### Full MemoryConfig reference

For finer control, configure each memory scope separately:

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import (
    MemoryConfig,
    UserMemoryConfig,
    AgentMemoryConfig,
    ReadMode,
)

memory = MemoryConfig(
    store=store,                              # required: BaseStore instance
    retrieval_mode=ReadMode.POSTLOAD,         # POSTLOAD (default) | PRELOAD
    limit=5,                                  # max memories to retrieve per search
    score_threshold=0.0,                      # minimum similarity score (0.0-1.0)
    max_tokens=None,                          # cap total tokens across all memories
    inject_system_prompt=True,                # prepend memories to system prompt

    user_memory=UserMemoryConfig(
        enabled=True,
        memory_type="semantic",               # EPISODIC | SEMANTIC | PROCEDURAL | ENTITY | RELATIONSHIP | DECLARATIVE | CUSTOM
        category="preferences",               # arbitrary label for grouping
        user_id=None,                         # override; falls back to config["user_id"]
        limit=5,
        score_threshold=0.6,
    ),

    agent_memory=AgentMemoryConfig(
        enabled=False,                        # disabled by default
        memory_type="semantic",
        category="knowledge",
        agent_id="my-agent",                  # groups memories by agent
        app_id="my-app",                      # groups memories by application
    ),
)

agent = Agent(model="gpt-4o", memory=memory)
```

### ReadMode: how the agent uses memories

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `ReadMode.POSTLOAD` (default) | Memories are fetched on-demand via injected tools that the LLM can call. The model decides **when** and **what** to retrieve. Gives the model more agency but requires the model to recognize when memories are relevant. |
| `ReadMode.PRELOAD` | Memories are retrieved automatically before every LLM call and injected into the system prompt. The model always has relevant context but uses more tokens. Better for smaller memory sets or when the model must always be aware. |

### UserMemoryConfig vs. AgentMemoryConfig

- **UserMemoryConfig:** Scoped to a single user (`user_id`). The agent can both **read and write** user memories. Use this for user preferences, learned facts about the user, and conversation summaries.
- **AgentMemoryConfig:** Scoped to the agent/application. The agent can **only read** agent memories. Use this for shared domain knowledge, FAQs, and system facts that should not be modified by user interactions.

---

## MemoryType and DistanceMetric enums

When configuring `UserMemoryConfig` or `AgentMemoryConfig`, specify the `memory_type` to categorize what kind of knowledge you're storing. Similarly, `DistanceMetric` controls how vector similarity is calculated.

### MemoryType values

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import MemoryType

MemoryType.EPISODIC       # Conversation events, session notes, "what happened"
MemoryType.SEMANTIC       # Facts, user preferences, "what is true"
MemoryType.PROCEDURAL     # How-to knowledge, step-by-step processes, "how to do it"
MemoryType.ENTITY         # Information about people, places, organizations
MemoryType.RELATIONSHIP   # How entities relate to each other
MemoryType.DECLARATIVE    # Explicit stated facts and declarations
MemoryType.CUSTOM         # Domain-specific memory types
```

### DistanceMetric values

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.store import DistanceMetric

DistanceMetric.COSINE        # Default; best for text embeddings
DistanceMetric.EUCLIDEAN     # Absolute vector distances; good for dense, normalized embeddings
DistanceMetric.DOT_PRODUCT   # Normalized vectors in high-dimensional spaces
DistanceMetric.MANHATTAN     # L1 distance; rarely used for embeddings
```

Use `DistanceMetric.COSINE` unless you have a specific reason to use another metric.

## Complete example: memory-aware customer support agent

Here's a runnable example that builds a customer support agent, talks to a customer twice (with different threads), and shows how memories persist across threads:

```python
import asyncio
from tenxgraph.core.graph import StateGraph, Agent
from tenxgraph.core.state import Message
from tenxgraph.storage.checkpointer import InMemoryCheckpointer
from tenxgraph.storage.store import (
    MemoryConfig,
    UserMemoryConfig,
    create_local_qdrant_store,
    OpenAIEmbedding,
    MemoryType,
)
from tenxgraph.utils import END

# Step 1: Create the memory store
store = create_local_qdrant_store(
    "./qdrant_data",
    OpenAIEmbedding(),
)

# Step 2: Configure agent-level memory for user preferences
memory = MemoryConfig(
    store=store,
    user_memory=UserMemoryConfig(
        enabled=True,
        memory_type="semantic",
        category="customer_preferences",
        limit=5,
        score_threshold=0.6,
    ),
)

# Step 3: Create an agent that uses memory
system_prompt = """You are a helpful customer support agent.
You have access to customer preferences and history.
Always be friendly and remember what the customer told you previously."""

agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    memory=memory,
)

# Step 4: Build the graph
graph = StateGraph()
graph.add_node("support", agent)
graph.set_entry_point("support")
graph.add_edge("support", END)

# Step 5: Compile with the store
app = graph.compile(
    checkpointer=InMemoryCheckpointer(),
    store=store,
)

async def main():
    # First interaction: customer shares a preference
    print("=== First conversation ===")
    result1 = await app.ainvoke(
        {
            "messages": [
                Message.text_message(
                    "Hi, I need help with my order. Also, I prefer email support over phone calls."
                )
            ]
        },
        config={
            "thread_id": "customer-123-session-1",
            "user_id": "customer-123",
        },
    )
    print("Agent:", result1["messages"][-1].content[:200])

    # Second interaction: different thread, same user
    # The agent should remember the email preference without being told again
    print("\n=== Second conversation (different thread, same user) ===")
    result2 = await app.ainvoke(
        {
            "messages": [
                Message.text_message("It's me again. Can you help with another issue?")
            ]
        },
        config={
            "thread_id": "customer-123-session-2",  # <-- different thread
            "user_id": "customer-123",              # <-- same user
        },
    )
    print("Agent:", result2["messages"][-1].content[:200])
    print("\nThe agent should have remembered the email preference from session 1.")

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. In the first interaction, the customer states a preference. The agent processes the message and the preference is stored in memory.
2. In the second interaction (different thread, same user), the agent retrieves the stored preference automatically and acts on it (e.g., "I'll reach out via email as you prefer").

---

## How to verify it worked

After running your agent with `MemoryConfig`, check that memories were stored:

1. **Check memory count:** Query the store directly to see how many memories are stored.

```python
# With Qdrant, you can inspect the collection
import qdrant_client

client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(path="./qdrant_data")
collection = client.get_collection(collection_name="agentflow_memories")
print(f"Total vectors in store: {collection.points_count}")
```

2. **Search for a specific memory:** Verify that a memory you expect is retrievable.

```python
results = await store.asearch(
    query="email preference",
    user_id="customer-123",
    limit=3,
)
for result in results:
    print(f"Score: {result.score:.2f}, Content: {result.content}")
```

3. **Monitor the agent:** Use `response_granularity` to see what memories the agent retrieved.

```python
result = await app.ainvoke(
    {"messages": [...]},
    config={
        "response_granularity": "FULL",  # returns full state including memory context
    },
)
```

---

## Common decisions and patterns

### When to use POSTLOAD vs. PRELOAD

- **POSTLOAD (default):** Use when the model should decide whether memories are relevant. Better for reasoning; the model calls memory tools when it needs them. Best for most agents.
- **PRELOAD:** Use when the model must always be aware of user context. Better for task-specific agents (e.g., a chatbot that always needs current preferences). Uses more tokens.

### Should I use UserMemoryConfig, AgentMemoryConfig, or both?

- **UserMemoryConfig only:** For user-centric systems (customer support, personal assistants, tutors). The agent learns and remembers about each user.
- **AgentMemoryConfig only:** For knowledge-centric systems (FAQ bots, knowledge bases). The agent has read-only access to shared facts.
- **Both:** Hybrid systems where the agent personalizes responses based on shared knowledge + user history. The agent reads both scopes but only writes to user memory.

### Choosing memory_type

Map your use case to a memory type:

- **EPISODIC:** "Customer mentioned they work in finance", a specific event or conversation fact.
- **SEMANTIC:** "Customer prefers email over phone", a persistent fact about preferences.
- **PROCEDURAL:** "Steps to reset a password", domain processes.
- **ENTITY:** "John Smith, VP of Engineering at Acme Corp", structured facts about people/organizations.
- **DECLARATIVE:** "Our return policy is 30 days", company policies or rules.
