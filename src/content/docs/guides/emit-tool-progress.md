## Overview

When your tools perform long-running tasks (like API calls, file processing, or multi-step operations), you can use `StreamEmitter` to send **live progress updates** to the frontend during streaming execution. This gives users visibility into what the tool is doing and can provide a better UX for slow operations.

### Key Concepts

- **StreamEmitter** is injected into tools **only during streaming** (`app.stream()` / `app.astream()`)
- During normal execution (`app.invoke()` / `app.ainvoke()`), tools receive `emit=None`
- Updates are sent to the same stream output that the frontend consumes
- No external publisher setup required, works with the built-in streaming pipeline

---

## When to Use StreamEmitter

Use `StreamEmitter` when:

**Do use for:**
- Long-running operations (API calls, file processing, database queries)
- Retries with multiple attempts (show which attempt is running)
- Multi-step processes (report progress per step)
- External service calls with timeout risk
- Batch processing (show item count progress)

**Do not use for:**
- Fast operations that complete in under 100 ms (overhead not worth it)
- Simple tool results that don't require intermediate feedback
- Non-streaming execution paths (emit is None anyway, so safe to call but won't do anything)

---

## Setup: Declare emit Parameter

The first step is to declare `emit` as an optional parameter in your tool function:

```python
from tenxgraph.core.state.stream_emitter import StreamEmitter

def my_tool(
    user_input: str,
    emit: StreamEmitter | None = None,  # Optional, auto-injected during streaming
) -> str:
    """Tool that can report progress during streaming."""
    if emit:
        emit.progress("Starting work...")
    # ... do work ...
    return "result"
```

### Key Details

- **Import:** `from tenxgraph.core.state.stream_emitter import StreamEmitter`
- **Parameter name:** Must be exactly `"emit"` (this is what the framework injects)
- **Type hint:** `StreamEmitter | None` tells type checkers it's optional
- **Always check:** Always do `if emit:` before calling emit methods (it's `None` during non-streaming)

---

## Example 1: Simple Progress Updates

**Scenario:** Fetching data from an external API with a known delay.

```python
import time
import requests
from tenxgraph.core.state.stream_emitter import StreamEmitter

def fetch_weather(location: str, emit: StreamEmitter | None = None) -> str:
    """Fetch weather data with progress updates."""
    
    if emit:
        emit.progress(f"Looking up weather for {location}...")
    
    # Simulate API delay
    time.sleep(2)
    
    if emit:
        emit.progress("Processing response...", data={"location": location})
    
    # Mock response for example
    result = f"Sunny, 72°F in {location}"
    
    if emit:
        emit.progress("Weather data ready")
    
    return result
```

**What happens during streaming:**
1. User sees "Looking up weather for Paris..." 
2. After 2 seconds: "Processing response..." with metadata
3. Finally: "Weather data ready"
4. Tool returns the actual result

**What happens during invoke():**
- All `if emit:` blocks are skipped (emit is None)
- Only the final result is returned

---

## Example 2: Retry Logic with Attempt Tracking

**Scenario:** An API call that might fail temporarily; retry with feedback.

```python
import requests
from tenxgraph.core.state.stream_emitter import StreamEmitter

def call_external_service(
    endpoint: str,
    emit: StreamEmitter | None = None,
) -> str:
    """Call an external service with retries and progress updates."""
    
    max_retries = 3
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            if emit and attempt > 0:
                # Report retry attempt
                emit.progress(
                    f"Retry attempt {attempt} of {max_retries - 1}",
                    data={
                        "attempt": attempt,
                        "max_attempts": max_retries - 1,
                    }
                )
            
            if emit and attempt == 0:
                emit.progress(f"Calling {endpoint}...")
            
            # Actual API call
            response = requests.get(endpoint, timeout=5)
            response.raise_for_status()
            
            return response.json()
        
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                # Final attempt failed
                if emit:
                    emit.error(
                        f"Service unreachable after {max_retries} attempts: {e}",
                        data={"final_attempt": True}
                    )
                raise
            # Try again in next loop iteration
```

**Frontend sees:**
1. "Calling https://api.example.com..."
2. After timeout: "Retry attempt 1 of 2"
3. After another timeout: "Retry attempt 2 of 2"
4. If still failing: "Service unreachable after 3 attempts: ..."

**Key insight:** Retries are now visible to the user instead of hanging silently.

## Full Graph Example

Here's a complete graph that uses `StreamEmitter`. Install with `pip install "10xgraph[google-genai]"` and set `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`:

```python
from tenxgraph.core.graph import StateGraph, Agent, ToolNode
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState, Message
from tenxgraph.storage.checkpointer import InMemoryCheckpointer
from tenxgraph.core.state.stream_emitter import StreamEmitter
from tenxgraph.utils.constants import END
import time

# Define tool with StreamEmitter
def get_weather(
    location: str,
    tool_call_id: str | None = None,
    emit: StreamEmitter | None = None,
) -> str:
    """Get weather for a location with streaming progress."""
    if emit:
        emit.progress(f"Fetching weather for {location}...")
    
    time.sleep(1)
    
    if emit:
        emit.progress("Processing data...", data={"location": location})
    
    time.sleep(1)
    
    if emit:
        emit.progress("Finalizing...", data={"location": location})
    
    return f"Sunny, 72°F in {location}"

# Build graph
checkpointer = InMemoryCheckpointer()
tool_node = ToolNode([get_weather])

agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    provider="google",
    system_prompt=[{
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a weather assistant. Use the get_weather tool when asked."
    }],
    tool_node=tool_node,
    trim_context=True,
)

graph = StateGraph()
graph.add_node("MAIN", agent)
graph.add_node("TOOL", tool_node)
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "MAIN",
    lambda state: "TOOL" if state.context[-1].tools_calls else END,
    {"TOOL": "TOOL", END: END},
)
graph.add_edge("TOOL", "MAIN")
graph.set_entry_point("MAIN")

app = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# Stream with progress updates
inp = {"messages": [Message.text_message("What's the weather in Paris?")]}
config = {"thread_id": "user_123", "is_stream": True}

print("Streaming response with progress updates:")
for chunk in app.stream(inp, config=config):
    # Check if this is a progress chunk from StreamEmitter
    if chunk.event == "message" and chunk.data and chunk.data.get("status") == "tool_progress":
        print(f"  [PROGRESS] {chunk.data['message']} ({chunk.data['tool_name']})")
    else:
        print(chunk)
```

## Best Practices

### Do

1. **Check before emitting:** Always do `if emit:` before calling emit methods
2. **Use meaningful messages:** Messages should tell users what's happening
3. **Add metadata:** Include `data` for important metrics (attempt numbers, percentages, etc.)
4. **Report milestones:** Emit at meaningful progress points, not every step
5. **Throttle batch work:** Emit every N items, not on every item

### Do not

1. **Don't emit too frequently:** Thousands of updates per second will slow down streaming
2. **Don't rely on emit:** Tool should always return a valid result regardless
3. **Don't emit sensitive data:** Progress chunks are exposed to frontend; sanitize if needed
4. **Don't use for critical flow:** Emit is informational only; never branch on it

### Performance Tips

```python
# Bad: Emits 1000 times per second
for item in items:
    if emit:
        emit.progress(f"Processing {item}")
    process(item)

# Good: Emits once per batch
for i, item in enumerate(items):
    if (i + 1) % 100 == 0 and emit:
        emit.progress(f"Processed {i + 1} of {len(items)}")
    process(item)
```
