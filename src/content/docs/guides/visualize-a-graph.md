  - q: "Can I export the graph as a diagram?"
    a: "Yes. The `generate_graph()` method returns nodes and edges as structured JSON, which you can render as a Mermaid diagram, SVG, or PNG using external libraries."
  - q: "When should I visualize my graph?"
    a: "Visualize your graph when building it (to validate structure), after adding conditional routing (to verify paths), and when debugging why runs take unexpected paths."
  - q: "Can I visualize a running agent?"
    a: "Yes. Call `GET /v1/graph` on the API server to retrieve the compiled graph structure at runtime, which reflects the current agent configuration."

Understanding your agent's structure is critical when debugging behavior, validating routing logic, and communicating your design to teammates. 10xGraph provides a straightforward way to inspect and visualize the compiled graph structure as JSON, which you can then render as diagrams or integrate into dashboards.

## Why visualize your graph

Agents built with 10xGraph are cyclic state machines: messages flow through nodes, conditional edges route to the next node, and loops continue until the agent reaches `END`. As graphs grow, it becomes easy to lose track of:

- Which nodes exist and how they connect
- How conditional routing splits execution into parallel or sequential paths
- Whether interrupts are set on the right nodes
- Whether all paths eventually reach `END` or a valid terminal state

A visual inspection of the compiled graph catches routing mistakes before they surface in production. It also helps new team members understand the agent's flow at a glance.

## Inspect the graph locally

Once your graph is compiled, call `generate_graph()` to retrieve its structure as a JSON-compatible dictionary.

Install the provider extra used by the sample: `pip install "10xgraph[google-genai]"`.

```python
from tenxgraph import StateGraph, Agent, END
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState

# Build a simple graph
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)

agent = Agent(model="gemini-2.5-flash", provider="google")
graph.add_node("agent", agent)

def route_to_end(state):
    return "end"

graph.add_conditional_edges("agent", route_to_end, {"end": END})
graph.set_entry_point("agent")

# Compile the graph
compiled = graph.compile()

# Inspect the structure
graph_data = compiled.generate_graph()

print(graph_data)
```

The returned dictionary contains three sections:

**`nodes`**: A list of every node in the graph. Each node has an `id` (a random UUID generated on each call) and `name` (the node's label). The name matches what you passed to `add_node()`. The list always includes the built-in `__start__` and `__end__` nodes.

**`edges`**: A list of connections between nodes. Each edge has an `id`, a `source` node name, and a `target` node name. Edges include explicit edges (from `add_edge()`), the `__start__` edge created by `set_entry_point()`, and conditional edges (from `add_conditional_edges()`), which appear as one edge per `path_map` entry. Edges carry no label, so the router condition itself is not visible.

**`info`**: Metadata about the graph, including:
- `node_count` and `edge_count`: totals
- `checkpointer` and `checkpointer_type`: persistence configuration
- `publisher` and `store`: whether each is configured
- `state_type` and `state_fields`: the state shape
- `interrupt_before` and `interrupt_after`: human-in-the-loop settings
- `context_type`, `id_generator` and `id_type`: runtime configuration

Example output:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "abc-123", "name": "agent"},
    {"id": "def-456", "name": "tool_node"},
    {"id": "ghi-789", "name": "__start__"},
    {"id": "jkl-012", "name": "__end__"}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"id": "edge-1", "source": "__start__", "target": "agent"},
    {"id": "edge-2", "source": "agent", "target": "tool_node"},
    {"id": "edge-3", "source": "tool_node", "target": "__end__"}
  ],
  "info": {
    "node_count": 4,
    "edge_count": 3,
    "checkpointer": true,
    "checkpointer_type": "PgCheckpointer",
    "state_type": "AgentState",
    "state_fields": ["context", "context_summary", "execution_meta"]
  }
}
```

## Retrieve the graph from the API server

If you are running 10xGraph as a FastAPI server, you can fetch the compiled graph structure over HTTP without needing direct access to the Python code.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/graph \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

The response wraps the same structure as `generate_graph()` in a `data` envelope, plus an additional `is_realtime` field in `info` that indicates whether the agent is a realtime/live agent (driven over `/v1/graph/live`). The `Authorization` header is only needed when auth is configured.

Example:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/v1/graph | jq '.data.nodes'
```

Returns a list like:

```json
[
  {"id": "abc-123", "name": "agent"},
  {"id": "def-456", "name": "tool_node"}
]
```

(plus the `__start__` and `__end__` nodes).

Use this endpoint to inspect live production agents without deploying extra code, or to build admin dashboards that visualize agent topology.

## Render the graph as a diagram

The nodes and edges structure is generic JSON, so you can render it with any visualization library. Here are two common approaches:

### Convert to Mermaid

Mermaid is a plain-text diagram syntax supported by GitHub, Confluence, and Notion. You can programmatically convert your 10xGraph output to Mermaid:

```python
def graph_to_mermaid(graph_data):
    """Convert generate_graph() output to Mermaid diagram syntax."""
    lines = ["graph TD"]
    
    for edge in graph_data["edges"]:
        source = edge["source"]
        target = edge["target"]
        # Escape special characters in node names
        source = source.replace("-", "_")
        target = target.replace("-", "_")
        lines.append(f'  {source} --> {target}')
    
    return "\n".join(lines)

# Usage
mermaid_code = graph_to_mermaid(graph_data)
print(mermaid_code)
# Output (shape):
# graph TD
#   __start__ --> agent
#   agent --> tool_node
#   tool_node --> __end__
```

Paste the output into a Markdown file or Mermaid editor to visualize it:

```mermaid
graph TD
  __start__ --> agent
  agent --> tool_node
  tool_node --> __end__
```

`generate_graph()` does not include edge labels, so conditional routes render as plain arrows.

### Visualize with a web dashboard

If you prefer interactive exploration, render the nodes and edges in a web UI using D3.js, Vis.js, or Cytoscape:

```python
import json
from tenxgraph import StateGraph, Agent, END
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState

graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
agent = Agent(model="gemini-2.5-flash", provider="google")
graph.add_node("agent", agent)
graph.add_conditional_edges("agent", lambda s: "end", {"end": END})
graph.set_entry_point("agent")

compiled = graph.compile()
graph_data = compiled.generate_graph()

# Serialize to JSON for your frontend
with open("graph.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(graph_data, f)
```

Then load and render in JavaScript:

```javascript
fetch("/graph.json")
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Use Vis.js, Cytoscape, or D3 to render nodes and edges
    const nodes = data.nodes.map(n => ({ id: n.name, label: n.name }));
    const edges = data.edges.map(e => ({ from: e.source, to: e.target }));
    // Pass to your visualization library
  });
```

## Verify your graph structure

After building and compiling a graph, use `generate_graph()` to verify:

**All nodes are present**: Check that every node you added with `add_node()` appears in the `nodes` list.

**Connections are correct**: Verify that each edge in `edges` matches your intended routing logic. Ensure that nodes you expected to be connected are present and in the right order.

**No orphaned nodes**: Ensure every node has at least one incoming edge (except `__start__`) and at least one outgoing edge (except `__end__`).

**Conditional edges are listed**: If you use conditional routing, the `edges` list includes one edge per `path_map` entry. Check that all branches you defined are present.

Example verification:

```python
graph_data = compiled.generate_graph()

# Verify expected nodes exist
expected_nodes = {"agent", "tool_node", "__start__", "__end__"}
actual_nodes = {n["name"] for n in graph_data["nodes"]}
assert expected_nodes == actual_nodes, f"Missing nodes: {expected_nodes - actual_nodes}"

# Verify no stray edges
assert graph_data["info"]["edge_count"] == len(graph_data["edges"])
```

## Common patterns

### Fan-out and fan-in

When your graph has a tool node that runs multiple tools in parallel, the structure looks like:

```
agent --> tool_node --> agent (loop back for more tools or end)
```

Verify that there is an edge from the tool node back to the agent. The tool node runs all requested tool calls from one response before control returns to the agent.

### Multi-step workflows

For workflows with sequential steps (e.g., Plan -> Act -> Reflect):

```
entry --> plan_node --> act_node --> reflect_node --> end
```

Check that each step has exactly one outgoing edge to the next step.

### Conditional branching

When you have branches (e.g., `if error then retry, else continue`):

```
agent --> conditional_node --> [path_a, path_b, ...]
```

Verify that all conditional branches eventually reconverge or reach a terminal state. A branch that has no outgoing edge is a bug.

## Debugging graph issues

If your agent behaves unexpectedly:

1. **Call `generate_graph()`** to see the compiled structure.
2. **Check the entry point** by looking for the edge whose `source` is `__start__`.
3. **Trace all paths** from entry to exit to ensure none are orphaned.
4. **Look for loops** (cycles) where a node feeds back into itself; these should be intentional (e.g., agent calls tools, tools return, agent loops).

If you suspect a conditional edge is routing incorrectly, add logging inside your conditional function:

```python
def my_router(state):
    choice = ...  # your logic
    print(f"Router decided: {choice}")  # Log the decision
    return choice

graph.add_conditional_edges("agent", my_router, {
    "path_a": "node_a",
    "path_b": "node_b",
})
```

Then run the agent and check the logs to see which branch was taken.
