10xGraph ships seven prebuilt agent classes that wrap a fully wired `StateGraph` behind a single constructor and `compile()` call. Each is a ready-made pattern for a common orchestration task. They compile to a `CompiledGraph` you can `invoke()`, `astream()`, or serve over the API server just like any graph you wrote by hand. This page helps you choose the right agent and points to detailed guides for each.

## Why prebuilt agents

A prebuilt agent solves the wiring problem: routing logic, message handling, loop termination, state reduction, and error recovery are already implemented. You provide the model, tools, and optional system prompt. When a prebuilt agent no longer fits your use case, move to a custom `StateGraph` and reuse the same components (you can read the agent's source to see exactly how it builds the graph).

## Quick comparison

| Agent | Use when | Graph shape |
|---|---|---|
| [ReactAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/react-agent) | One model calls tools in a loop until done | MAIN -> TOOL (conditional) -> END |
| [PlanActReflectAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/plan-act-reflect-agent) | Task needs a plan, execution, and reflection cycle | PLAN -> ACT -> REFLECT (conditional loop) -> END |
| [StructuredOutputAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/structured-output-agent) | Output must match a Pydantic schema | MAIN (with output_schema) -> REPAIR (if invalid JSON) -> END |
| [RAGAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/rag-agent) | Answers must come from a document store | RETRIEVE -> MAIN -> END |
| [SupervisorTeamAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/supervisor-team-agent) | One coordinator routes tasks to specialists | SUPERVISOR -> WORKERS (conditional) -> END |
| [SwarmAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/swarm-agent) | Peer agents hand off to each other | MEMBERS (dynamic handoffs) -> END |
| [AudioAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/audio-agent) | Real-time audio conversations (Gemini Live) | LIVE (streaming audio session) |

## Each prebuilt agent

### ReactAgent

The most common pattern. A single LLM calls tools in a loop, processes results, and decides what to do next until it has enough information to answer the user's question.

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import ReactAgent
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.tools import fetch_url, safe_calculator

agent = ReactAgent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[fetch_url, safe_calculator],
)
app = agent.compile()
```

**When to use:** Answering questions, research, data gathering, or any task where the agent needs to choose its own tools and loop until done. This is the default starting point.

See [ReactAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/react-agent) for customization, system prompts, MCP integration, and the full constructor.

### PlanActReflectAgent

Breaks complex multi-step tasks into three phases: first the LLM plans the steps, then it executes each using tools, then a reflector evaluates success and decides whether to continue or replan.

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import PlanActReflectAgent
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.tools import fetch_url, google_web_search

agent = PlanActReflectAgent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    tools=[fetch_url, google_web_search],
)
app = agent.compile()
```

**When to use:** Complex research, report writing, multi-part analysis, or any task where you want explicit visibility into planning and self-correction. Costs more (three LLM calls per task) but better for intricate goals.

See [PlanActReflectAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/plan-act-reflect-agent) for step configuration and graph layout.

### StructuredOutputAgent

Guarantees the response is a JSON object matching a Pydantic schema. The agent tries once, and if the output is invalid JSON or fails schema validation, a repair node tries to fix it before returning.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import StructuredOutputAgent

class ReviewData(BaseModel):
    sentiment: str
    score: float
    summary: str

agent = StructuredOutputAgent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    output_schema=ReviewData,
)
app = agent.compile()
```

**When to use:** Data extraction, classification, form filling, or any task where you need reliable structured output. The schema is also forwarded to the LLM as a constraint, improving accuracy.

See [StructuredOutputAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/structured-output-agent) for repair strategies and options.

### RAGAgent

Retrieval-augmented generation. Queries a document store to find relevant context, optionally reranks results, and passes them to a wrapped agent so answers come from your documents.

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import RAGAgent
from tenxgraph.core.graph import Agent
from tenxgraph.storage import create_local_qdrant_store

store = create_local_qdrant_store(path="./knowledge_base")

agent = RAGAgent(
    store=store,
    agent=Agent(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    top_k=5,
)
app = agent.compile()
```

**When to use:** Customer support bots, internal knowledge bases, company-specific Q&A, or any task where the answer must come from a known set of documents. Reduces hallucination and ensures sources.

See [RAGAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/rag-agent) for store setup, reranking, and retrieval strategies.

### SupervisorTeamAgent

A supervisor LLM receives the request and routes it to one of several specialist worker agents. Each worker is a fully configured agent with its own model, tools, and prompt. The supervisor orchestrates routing based on the task.

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import SupervisorTeamAgent, WorkerConfig
from tenxgraph.core.graph import Agent, ToolNode

supervisor = SupervisorTeamAgent(
    supervisor_model="gpt-4o",
    workers={
        "ORDERS": WorkerConfig(
            agent=Agent(model="gpt-4o-mini", tool_node=ToolNode([lookup_order])),
            description="Handles order lookups.",
        ),
        "REFUNDS": WorkerConfig(
            agent=Agent(model="gpt-4o-mini", tool_node=ToolNode([refund_order])),
            description="Handles refunds.",
        ),
    },
)
app = supervisor.compile()
```

**When to use:** Multi-domain systems where different tasks require different tools or expertise (e.g., a support agent with orders, refunds, billing). A centralized router keeps decisions clear.

See [SupervisorTeamAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/supervisor-team-agent) for worker configuration, custom routing prompts, and scaling.

### SwarmAgent

Peer agents hand off directly to each other without a central supervisor. Each member decides which other member (if any) should handle the task next. Handoff tools are injected automatically.

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import SwarmAgent, SwarmMemberConfig
from tenxgraph.core.graph import Agent, ToolNode

swarm = SwarmAgent(
    members={
        "TRIAGE": SwarmMemberConfig(
            agent=Agent(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
            can_handoff_to=["ORDERS", "REFUNDS"],
            description="Routes requests.",
        ),
        "ORDERS": SwarmMemberConfig(
            agent=Agent(model="gpt-4o", tool_node=ToolNode([lookup_order])),
            can_handoff_to=["REFUNDS"],
            description="Handles orders.",
        ),
        "REFUNDS": SwarmMemberConfig(
            agent=Agent(model="gpt-4o", tool_node=ToolNode([refund_order])),
            can_handoff_to=[],
            description="Handles refunds.",
        ),
    },
    entry="TRIAGE",
)
app = swarm.compile()
```

**When to use:** Systems where agents collaborate and hand off to peers (vs. one central router). Good for flexible workflows and decentralized decision-making.

See [SwarmAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/swarm-agent) for member configuration, handoff permissions, and parallel thinking.

### AudioAgent

Enables real-time audio-to-audio conversations through Gemini Live (streaming audio sessions). The agent listens, processes, and responds with audio in a single bidirectional stream.

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import AudioAgent

agent = AudioAgent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    tools=[fetch_url, safe_calculator],
)
# Driven by CompiledGraph.arealtime(), not invoke() or stream()
```

**When to use:** Real-time voice applications, audio chatbots, conversational interfaces, or any task where low-latency audio I/O is critical. Requires Gemini Live and WebSocket or similar transport.

See [AudioAgent](/docs/guides/prebuilt/audio-agent) for realtime configuration, stream handling, and tools.

## Extending with custom tools

All prebuilt agents accept a `tools` list. Pass prebuilt tools together with your own functions:

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import ReactAgent
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.tools import safe_calculator

def lookup_order(order_id: str) -> str:
    """Fetch the status of an order."""
    return f"Order {order_id}: shipped."

agent = ReactAgent(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    tools=[lookup_order, safe_calculator],
)
app = agent.compile()
```

The decorator `@tool` and type hints tell the LLM the tool's schema automatically. See [Use the tool decorator](/docs/guides/use-tool-decorator) for how to define tools with parameters, error handling, and dependency injection.

## Compile and run

All prebuilt agents expose the same `compile()` signature. Specify persistence, checkpointing, and callbacks here:

```python
app = agent.compile(
    checkpointer=InMemoryCheckpointer(),  # or PgCheckpointer for production
    store=memory_store,                    # for long-term memory
    interrupt_before=["TOOL"],             # pause before tool node
    interrupt_after=["MAIN"],              # pause after main node
    callback_manager=callback_manager,     # lifecycle hooks
    media_store=media_store,               # for multimodal content
    shutdown_timeout=30.0,                 # graceful shutdown wait
)
```

Once compiled, use `invoke()`, `astream()`, `stream()` or serve over the API server. See [Build a graph](/docs/guides/build-a-graph) for examples of running and routing.

## When to move to a custom graph

Prebuilt agents are opinionated. If you need:
- A different control flow (e.g., branching that is not tool calls)
- Multiple independent agent steps in parallel
- Custom state fields beyond messages
- A node that is not an Agent or ToolNode

then read the agent's page for its graph layout, and move to a custom `StateGraph`. You get the same execution runtime, checkpointing, and streaming tools; you just define the nodes and edges yourself. See [Build a graph](/docs/guides/build-a-graph) for the pattern.

## Next steps

- Pick an agent from the table above and read its detailed guide.
- [Use the tool decorator](/docs/guides/use-tool-decorator) to write custom tools.
- [Set up checkpointing](/docs/guides/set-up-checkpointing) for state persistence.
- [Stream a graph](/docs/guides/stream-graph) to get incremental results.
