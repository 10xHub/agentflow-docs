Every 10xGraph agent runs within an `AgentState` instance that persists data across all nodes in the graph. By default, `AgentState` holds the message conversation history and execution metadata. You extend it by subclassing to add typed, persistent application fields, like user IDs, ticket numbers, sentiment scores, or any domain-specific data your agent needs. The graph threads the state through every node and saves it with the checkpointer.

## Why custom state

Custom state fields let you:
- Track data that threads through the entire agent execution
- Use placeholders in system prompts (`"Help user {user_id}"`) interpolated at runtime
- Persist application context across multiple invocations via checkpointing
- Structure decision-making (conditional edges read custom fields to route the graph)
- Pass initial values into a run without rebuilding the graph

Without custom state, you would store this data outside the graph, losing the automatic persistence and threading benefits of the framework.

## Built-in fields

`AgentState` provides three fields you can read and build on:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `context` | `list[Message]` | The conversation history (new messages are appended with the `add_messages` reducer and deduplicated by `message_id`) |
| `context_summary` | `str \| None` | Optional compressed summary of older messages |
| `execution_meta` | `ExecutionState` | Internal metadata tracking node progress, interrupts, and step counts. Read-only for most use cases. |

---

## Step 1: Define a custom state class

Create a Pydantic model that extends `AgentState`:

```python
from pydantic import Field
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState


class SupportTicketState(AgentState):
    """Custom state for a support agent."""
    
    user_id: str = ""
    ticket_id: str | None = None
    sentiment: str = "neutral"  # "positive" | "neutral" | "negative"
    escalation_count: int = 0
    resolved: bool = False
    tags: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

All Pydantic features work: type hints, validators, `default_factory`, optional fields, computed fields. The built-in fields (`context`, `context_summary`, `execution_meta`) are inherited automatically.

---

## Step 2: Pass your state class to StateGraph

Instantiate the graph with your custom state class or instance:

```python
from tenxgraph.core.graph import StateGraph

# Option A: Pass the class (StateGraph instantiates it)
graph = StateGraph(SupportTicketState)

# Option B: Pass a pre-populated instance with defaults
initial_state = SupportTicketState(user_id="user-456")
graph = StateGraph(initial_state)
```

Both approaches work. The instance is a prototype: a new thread starts from a deep copy of it, and a thread that already has a saved state loads that state instead. Option B lets you bake in different defaults.

---

## Step 3: Read and update custom fields in nodes

Node functions receive the current state (declare a `state` parameter). Change the fields you need on the state object and return it. A node can also return a `str`, a `Message`, a list of messages, or a `Command`; a plain `dict` is not a valid return value. See [use custom nodes](/docs/guides/use-custom-nodes).

```python
from tenxgraph.core.state import Message


def classify_sentiment(state: SupportTicketState, config: dict) -> SupportTicketState:
    """Analyze the last user message and update sentiment."""
    last_user_msg = next(
        (m for m in reversed(state.context) if m.role == "user"), None
    )
    if not last_user_msg:
        return state

    text = last_user_msg.text().lower()
    if any(word in text for word in ["angry", "terrible", "worst", "unacceptable"]):
        state.sentiment = "negative"
        state.escalation_count += 1
    elif any(word in text for word in ["great", "thanks", "excellent", "happy"]):
        state.sentiment = "positive"
    else:
        state.sentiment = "neutral"
    return state


def resolve_ticket(state: SupportTicketState, config: dict) -> SupportTicketState:
    """Mark the ticket resolved and append a closing message."""
    state.resolved = True
    state.tags = ["handled", "closed"] if state.ticket_id else []
    state.context.append(
        Message.text_message(
            f"Ticket {state.ticket_id} has been resolved. Thank you for using our support.",
            role="assistant",
        )
    )
    return state
```

When a node returns the state, the runtime keeps the new field values and records any new entries in `state.context` as new messages of the run.

---

## Step 4: Use custom fields in system prompts

The `Agent` class interpolates state field values into system prompts at runtime:

```python
from tenxgraph.core.graph import Agent

agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    system_prompt=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": (
                "You are a customer support agent assisting user {user_id}. "
                "Ticket: {ticket_id}. Current sentiment: {sentiment}. "
                "This is escalation #{escalation_count}."
            ),
        }
    ],
)
```

Placeholders in curly braces are filled from the current state with `str.format`. If any placeholder names a field the state does not have, a warning is logged and the whole prompt is sent without interpolation. A field set to `None` renders as `None` (so `ticket_id` above reads `Ticket: None` until it is set). Escape literal braces as `{{` and `}}`.

---

## Step 5: Pass initial values at invocation

Messages go under `"messages"`. Custom field values go under a `"state"` key:

```python
from tenxgraph.utils import ResponseGranularity

result = app.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [Message.text_message("My order hasn't arrived.")],
        "state": {
            "user_id": "cust-789",
            "ticket_id": "TKT-2024-001",
            "sentiment": "negative",
        },
    },
    config={"thread_id": "support-session-1"},
    response_granularity=ResponseGranularity.FULL,
)
print(result["state"].ticket_id)
```

Only keys that already exist as fields on your state class are applied; `context`, `context_summary` and `execution_meta` are skipped. By default `invoke` returns only `messages` and `token_usage`. Pass `response_granularity=ResponseGranularity.FULL` (from `tenxgraph.utils`) to also get the final `state` object.

---

## Reducers: combining concurrent updates

A reducer is a function `(left, right) -> merged`, attached to a field with `Annotated`. The runtime uses a field's reducer when parallel tool calls in one `ToolNode` step both change the same field: their changes are combined with the reducer instead of one overwriting the other. Without a reducer the last write wins and a warning is logged. Reducers are not applied to values returned from ordinary function nodes; there you assign the field yourself.

10xGraph provides these in `tenxgraph.core.state`:

### `add_messages` (append with deduplication)

Appends new messages and deduplicates by `message_id`. This is the default reducer for the `context` field. Use it for any message list field:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState, Message
from tenxgraph.core.state.reducers import add_messages
from pydantic import Field


class PipelineState(AgentState):
    # A separate log of intermediate messages, also deduplicated by ID
    processing_log: Annotated[list[Message], add_messages] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

When two parallel tool calls each add messages to `processing_log`, both sets are appended. A message whose ID already exists is skipped. The same function is what keeps `context` free of duplicate messages.

### `replace_messages` (replace entire list)

Replaces the entire message list with the new one. Use this when the latest write should win outright:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from tenxgraph.core.state.reducers import replace_messages


class SummarizedState(AgentState):
    # This field is always replaced, never appended
    summary_messages: Annotated[list[Message], replace_messages] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

When the reducer runs, the old list is discarded and replaced by the new one.

### `append_items` (append objects with id deduplication)

Appends items to a list and deduplicates by each item's `.id` attribute. Use this for domain objects:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from tenxgraph.core.state.reducers import append_items
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel


class ToolResult(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str
    value: str


class ToolState(AgentState):
    # Append tool results, deduplicated by their .id
    tool_results: Annotated[list[ToolResult], append_items] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

When the reducer runs, new items are appended. An item with an `.id` that already exists is skipped.

### `replace_value` (replace a value)

Returns the new value and ignores the old one. Use it to make last-write-wins explicit:

```python
from tenxgraph.core.state.reducers import replace_value


class MyState(AgentState):
    status: Annotated[str, replace_value] = "pending"
    counter: int = 0  # No reducer: last write wins, with a warning on a parallel conflict
```

### `remove_tool_messages` (prune completed tool sequences)

Unlike the others, this takes a single list and returns the pruned list, so it is a plain helper, not a field reducer. It removes completed tool interaction sequences to keep context lean. A sequence is only removed if it is **complete**:

1. An assistant message with tool calls
2. One or more tool result messages
3. A final assistant message without tool calls (using the tool results)

If a sequence is incomplete (tool call made but no final response yet), all messages are kept:

```python
from tenxgraph.core.state.reducers import remove_tool_messages


def prune(state: AgentState, config: dict) -> AgentState:
    state.context = remove_tool_messages(state.context)
    return state
```

This is useful in long-running agents where you want to drop tool calls and results after the model has used them, reducing token usage on later calls.

## Complete example

Here is a working example that ties it together. Install a provider extra first, for example `pip install "10xgraph[openai]"`, and set `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

```python
from pydantic import Field
from tenxgraph.core.graph import StateGraph, Agent
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState, Message
from tenxgraph.utils import END, ResponseGranularity


# Define custom state
class ResearchState(AgentState):
    research_topic: str = ""
    findings: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    sources: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
    confidence: float = 0.0


# Define a node that processes custom fields
def extract_findings(state: ResearchState, config: dict) -> ResearchState:
    """Extract key findings from the last response."""
    if not state.context:
        return state

    text = state.context[-1].text()

    # Simplified extraction: split by "Finding:" markers
    findings = [
        f.strip()
        for f in text.split("Finding:")[1:]
        if f.strip()
    ]

    state.findings = findings
    state.confidence = 0.85 if len(findings) > 2 else 0.5
    return state


# Build the graph
graph = StateGraph(ResearchState)

agent = Agent(
    model="gpt-4o",
    system_prompt=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": (
                "You are a research assistant. "
                "Research topic: {research_topic}. "
                "Your confidence level: {confidence}. "
                "List your findings prefixed with 'Finding:'."
            ),
        }
    ],
)

graph.add_node("research", agent)
graph.add_node("extract", extract_findings)
graph.set_entry_point("research")
graph.add_edge("research", "extract")
graph.add_edge("extract", END)

app = graph.compile()

# Invoke with initial state values
result = app.invoke(
    {
        "messages": [Message.text_message("Research the benefits of remote work.")],
        "state": {"research_topic": "Remote work productivity"},
    },
    config={"thread_id": "research-session-1"},
    response_granularity=ResponseGranularity.FULL,
)

final = result["state"]
print("Findings:", final.findings)
print("Confidence:", final.confidence)
```

---

## How to verify it worked

Invoke with `response_granularity=ResponseGranularity.FULL` so the result includes the final state, then check:

1. **State is threaded:** custom fields hold the values you expect.

```python
state = result["state"]
print(state.user_id)      # Should match what you passed
print(state.sentiment)    # Should reflect updates from nodes
print(len(state.context)) # Messages should be accumulated
```

2. **Checkpointing preserves state:** `compile()` uses an in-memory checkpointer by default, so invoking again with the same `thread_id` in the same process continues from the saved state.

```python
result2 = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [Message.text_message("Follow-up question.")]},
    config={"thread_id": "support-session-1"},
    response_granularity=ResponseGranularity.FULL,
)
assert result2["state"].user_id == state.user_id
```

## Common errors and fixes

**Error: `AttributeError` or a Pydantic error mentioning a missing field**

You accessed or assigned a field that is not defined in your state class. Add it:

```python
class SupportTicketState(AgentState):
    my_field: str = ""  # Add the missing field
```

**My field in `"state"` was ignored.**

Only keys that already exist on the state class are applied, and `context`, `context_summary` and `execution_meta` are always skipped. Check the spelling, and pass messages under `"messages"`.

**The system prompt shows raw `{placeholders}`.**

A placeholder names a field the state does not have, so interpolation was skipped for the whole prompt and a warning was logged. Add the field to your state class with a default:

```python
class MyState(AgentState):
    user_id: str = "unknown"
```

**My custom state updates do not persist across restarts.**

The default checkpointer is in memory. Pass a durable one to `compile()`, for example `SqliteCheckpointer` (`pip install "10xgraph[sqlite_checkpoint]"`):

```python
from tenxgraph.storage.checkpointer import SqliteCheckpointer

app = graph.compile(checkpointer=SqliteCheckpointer(db_path="./state.db"))
```

---

## Variations and best practices

**Typed reducers for custom types:** If your field is a list of domain objects, use `append_items`:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState
from tenxgraph.core.state.reducers import append_items


class Item(BaseModel):
    id: str
    name: str

class MyState(AgentState):
    items: Annotated[list[Item], append_items] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

**Combining multiple reducers:** You can have different fields with different reducers in the same state:

```python
from typing import Annotated
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState, Message
from tenxgraph.core.state.reducers import add_messages, replace_value, append_items


class MultiReducerState(AgentState):
    messages_log: Annotated[list[Message], add_messages] = Field(default_factory=list)
    latest_status: Annotated[str, replace_value] = "pending"
    collected_items: Annotated[list[Item], append_items] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

**Initializing with factory defaults:** For complex fields, use `Field(default_factory=...)`:

```python
class MyState(AgentState):
    metadata: dict = Field(default_factory=dict)
    tags: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

This ensures each graph instance gets its own dict/list, not a shared one (a common Python pitfall).
