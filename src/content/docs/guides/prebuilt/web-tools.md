The web tools package provides three complementary prebuilt tools for agents that research, fact-check, or ground their answers in real-time data. `fetch_url` retrieves and parses a single web page with built-in SSRF protection; `google_web_search` searches the public web with source attribution; and `vertex_ai_search` searches private datastore collections. Together they enable research workflows where agents discover relevant sources, fetch full content, and synthesize findings.

**Import path:** `tenxgraph.prebuilt.tools`

## Prerequisites

Install the core library and Google GenAI extras:

```bash
pip install "10xgraph[google-genai]"
```

Set your Google API credentials:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
# or use Application Default Credentials if running on Google Cloud
```

All tools require Python 3.12 or later.

## fetch_url: Fetch and parse web pages

Use `fetch_url` when you need the full content of a specific URL. It is synchronous-friendly (runs in a thread pool), implements SSRF protection to block access to private networks, and strips HTML boilerplate to return clean text. The tool is ideal for following links that `google_web_search` surfaces, deep-reading documentation, or scraping specific data from known URLs.

### How it works

`fetch_url` performs several steps to make raw web content usable:

1. **Validates the URL**: accepts only HTTP and HTTPS schemes.
2. **Blocks private addresses**: prevents Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by resolving the hostname and rejecting private, loopback, link-local, multicast, reserved, or unspecified IP ranges (RFC 1918, 127.0.0.0/8, fe80::/10, etc.).
3. **Fetches with timeout**: requests data with a 10-second timeout by default, clamped between 1 and 30 seconds.
4. **Extracts text**: if the content is HTML, parses it and strips tags, scripts, and style blocks, preserving semantic line breaks for readability.
5. **Truncates**: limits output to 20,000 characters by default to avoid overwhelming the LLM context.
6. **Returns metadata**: includes the final URL (after redirects), HTTP status code, content type, and a `truncated` flag indicating overflow.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `url` | `str` | required | HTTP or HTTPS only | Public URL to fetch |
| `timeout` | `float` | `10.0` | 1-30 seconds | Request timeout; values outside the range are clamped |
| `max_chars` | `int` | `20000` | 1-20000 | Maximum characters in response; enforces a hard ceiling |

### Response structure

All fields are always present in the response, returned as JSON:

```json
{
  "url": "https://docs.example.com/api-guide",
  "status_code": 200,
  "content_type": "text/html; charset=utf-8",
  "content": "API Guide\n\nThis guide describes the HTTP API...",
  "truncated": false
}
```

If an error occurs (network failure, SSRF rejection, timeout), the response includes an `"error"` field and may include `"status_code"` for HTTP errors:

```json
{
  "error": "URL host is not public or could not be resolved",
  "status_code": null
}
```

### Example: Build a fact-checking agent

The following agent uses `google_web_search` to find claims and `fetch_url` to read full source articles:

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.tools import fetch_url, google_web_search
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import ReactAgent

agent = ReactAgent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    tools=[fetch_url, google_web_search],
    system_prompt=[{
        "role": "system",
        "content": (
            "You are a fact-checker. Use google_web_search to find relevant sources, "
            "then use fetch_url to read the full content and verify claims. "
            "Always cite your sources by URL."
        ),
    }],
)

graph = agent.compile()

input_state = {
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Is Python the most popular programming language?"}
    ]
}

result = graph.invoke(input_state)
print(result["messages"][-1]["content"])
```

### Common errors and fixes

**SSRF rejection:** If you see `"error": "URL host is not public or could not be resolved"`, the address is private (e.g., `192.168.1.1`, `localhost:8000`). This is intentional protection. Bypass by either using a public proxy or whitelisting specific hosts in your agent logic (not the tool itself).

**Timeout:** If `fetch_url` does not return within the timeout window, you see `"error": "URL error: ..."`. Increase the `timeout` parameter up to 30 seconds, or implement retry logic in your agent.

**Content truncated:** Check the `"truncated": true` flag. If essential content was cut off, increase `max_chars` (up to 20,000) or handle multi-part fetching in your agent by asking for specific sections.

**Encoding errors:** HTML with unusual encodings may produce garbled text in the `content` field. This is normal; the tool uses UTF-8 with error replacement, so decoding issues are replaced with fallback characters.

## google_web_search: Search the public web with grounding

Use `google_web_search` to discover relevant information without needing exact URLs. It calls the Google GenAI API with the Gemini Google Search tool enabled, so answers are grounded in real-time search results with source attribution. Unlike traditional search APIs that return a list of links, `google_web_search` returns a synthesized answer directly, making it faster for agents to extract facts.

### How it works

The tool sends your query to the Gemini API with Google Search integration enabled. The model performs a web search, synthesizes an answer, and returns both the text and grounding metadata (search queries used, source chunks with attribution).

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | `str` | required | Your search question or query |
| `model` | `str` | `"gemini-2.5-flash"` | Gemini model for synthesis; supports `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`, etc. |
| `max_chars` | `int` | `20000` | Maximum characters in the synthesized content |

### Response structure

The response includes the synthesized answer and grounding metadata for citation:

```json
{
  "content": "Python is consistently ranked as one of the top programming languages...",
  "grounding_metadata": {
    "web_search_queries": ["most popular programming languages 2024"],
    "grounding_chunks": [
      {
        "web": {
          "uri": "https://example.com/rankings",
          "title": "2024 Programming Language Rankings"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "truncated": false
}
```

If an error occurs (missing SDK, invalid query, network failure), you receive an error object:

```json
{
  "error": "google-genai is required for google_web_search. Install with: pip install 10xgraph[google-genai]"
}
```

### Example: Research assistant with source tracking

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.tools import google_web_search
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import ReactAgent
from tenxgraph.core.state import Message

agent = ReactAgent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    tools=[google_web_search],
    system_prompt=[{
        "role": "system",
        "content": (
            "You are a research assistant. Answer questions using web search. "
            "Always include sources from the grounding metadata."
        ),
    }],
)

graph = agent.compile()

result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [
        Message.text_message("What is the current state of AI safety research?")
    ]
})

print(result["messages"][-1]["content"])
```

### When to use google_web_search vs. fetch_url

| Scenario | Tool | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| You know the exact URL | `fetch_url` | Faster, no API call needed |
| You need current, real-time answers | `google_web_search` | Includes live search results |
| You need source attribution | `google_web_search` | Returns grounding metadata with URIs |
| You need full page content | `fetch_url` | Extract all text and structure |
| Budget is tight (fewer API calls) | `fetch_url` | Avoids a Gemini API call |

### Common errors and fixes

**Missing google-genai:** If you see the install error, run `pip install "10xgraph[google-genai]"` and ensure `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set.

**Empty grounding_metadata:** If `grounding_metadata` is `null`, the query had no search results. Rephrase the query or check that your API key is valid.

**Rate limits:** Google GenAI API has usage limits. If you hit limits, add a retry delay in your agent or use a lower `max_chars` to reduce processing load.

## vertex_ai_search: Search private datastores

Use `vertex_ai_search` to ground answers in a private document collection without exposing it to the public internet. This tool searches a Vertex AI Search datastore (Google Cloud's enterprise search solution) using Gemini, making it ideal for agents that need to answer questions about proprietary documentation, internal knowledge bases, or sensitive data.

### How it works

The tool queries your configured Vertex AI Search datastore with the Gemini API (v1 endpoint), which returns grounded results similar to `google_web_search` but scoped to your datastore. You must provide the full Vertex AI Search resource path.

### Prerequisites

1. Create a Vertex AI Search datastore in Google Cloud Console (go to Vertex AI > Search and Information Retrieval > Datastores).
2. Index your documents (structured or unstructured).
3. Ensure your Google Cloud credentials have `discoveryengine.datastores.search` permission.
4. Obtain the full datastore resource path (shown in the console or via `gcloud`):

```
projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/YOUR_DATASTORE_ID
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `query` | `str` | required | Question or search text |
| `datastore` | `str` | required | Full Vertex AI Search datastore resource path |
| `model` | `str` | `"gemini-2.5-flash"` | Gemini model for synthesis |
| `max_chars` | `int` | `20000` | Maximum characters in the response |

### Response structure

The response matches `google_web_search` in format:

```json
{
  "content": "Our internal policy on remote work states...",
  "grounding_metadata": {
    "grounding_chunks": [
      {
        "web": {
          "uri": "projects/.../documents/document-123"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "truncated": false
}
```

### Example: Internal knowledge base agent

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.tools import vertex_ai_search
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import ReactAgent

DATASTORE = "projects/my-company-123/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/policies-store"

agent = ReactAgent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    tools=[vertex_ai_search],
    system_prompt=[{
        "role": "system",
        "content": (
            "You are an HR assistant. Answer questions about company policies using "
            "the internal knowledge base. If you find relevant documents, cite them."
        ),
    }],
)

def search_internal(query: str) -> str:
    """Inject the datastore path at agent initialization time."""
    result = agent.compile().invoke({
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": query}]
    })
    return result["messages"][-1]["content"]

# Usage:
answer = search_internal("What is our remote work policy?")
print(answer)
```

### When to use vertex_ai_search

- Your data is sensitive and must stay within Google Cloud.
- You have large document collections (thousands of documents) that need efficient indexing.
- Your agent requires consistent, controlled answers from a fixed knowledge base.
- You want to avoid exposing internal URLs or document structures.

### Common errors and fixes

**Datastore not found:** Double-check the resource path format and that the datastore exists in your project and region. The path must include `locations/global` and the correct `dataStores/ID`.

**Permission denied:** Ensure your Google Cloud service account or user has the `discoveryengine.datastores.search` role. Run `gcloud projects get-iam-policy YOUR_PROJECT_ID` to verify.

**Empty results:** If your datastore returns no matches, your documents may not be indexed yet or the query is too specific. Test the datastore directly in the Google Cloud Console.

## Building multi-tool research workflows

The real power emerges when you combine these tools. A typical workflow:

1. **Discover:** `google_web_search` identifies relevant sources and pages.
2. **Deep-read:** `fetch_url` retrieves full content from those pages.
3. **Synthesize:** The agent combines findings into a comprehensive answer.

Here is a complete example:

```python
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.tools import fetch_url, google_web_search
from tenxgraph.prebuilt.agent import ReactAgent
from tenxgraph.core.state import Message

agent = ReactAgent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    tools=[fetch_url, google_web_search],
    system_prompt=[{
        "role": "system",
        "content": (
            "You are a research analyst. For complex questions: "
            "1. Use google_web_search to find relevant pages. "
            "2. Use fetch_url to read the full content of the most promising sources. "
            "3. Synthesize a detailed answer citing your sources."
        ),
    }],
)

graph = agent.compile()

query = "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [Message.text_message(query)]
})

print(result["messages"][-1]["content"])
```

The agent autonomously decides when to search broadly (with `google_web_search`), dig deeper into specific sources (with `fetch_url`), and how to structure its findings. This pattern scales to larger research tasks like competitive analysis, due diligence, or continuous monitoring.

## Error handling and resilience

All three tools return JSON responses. Successful or not, you receive a JSON object (never an exception). Check for the presence of `"error"` field:

```python
import json

async def safe_web_search(query: str) -> dict:
    result = await google_web_search(query)
    data = json.loads(result)
    
    if "error" in data:
        print(f"Search failed: {data['error']}")
        return None
    
    return data
```

In production agents, implement retry logic at the graph level (using `RetryConfig` on the node) or at the tool level (wrap the tool to add exponential backoff). For network timeouts, increase the `timeout` parameter on `fetch_url` or add retry steps to your agent's system prompt.
