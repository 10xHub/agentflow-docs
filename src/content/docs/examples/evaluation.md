faq:
  - q: "Why are the example tests skipped?"
    a: "Most test modules call pytest.skip at import time so a root-level pytest run does not call a live model. Remove that call in the module you want to run."
  - q: "Which API key does the example need?"
    a: "The shared weather agent uses the Google provider with gemini-2.5-flash, so set GEMINI_API_KEY or GOOGLE_API_KEY in your environment. The user simulator also defaults to a Gemini model."
  - q: "When should I use evaluation instead of unit tests?"
    a: "Use unit tests for deterministic graph logic with a mocked model. Use evaluation when you need to score a real agent's tool calls, trajectory, response quality or multi-turn goals."

This example evaluates a small weather agent end to end: it defines eval cases, runs quick checks, scores tool trajectories, simulates multi-turn users and writes JSON, HTML and JUnit reports. It shows how to measure whether a real agent behaves correctly, which unit tests with a mocked model cannot do.

## What the example contains

The example lives in `agentflow/examples/evaluation`. One shared weather agent graph backs five test folders, each focused on a different part of the evaluation API.

| Path | What it shows |
|---|---|
| `test_graph/__init__.py` | The weather agent graph and `create_app_and_collector()` |
| `samples.py` | Shared `EvalCase` and `EvalSet` definitions, including trajectory cases |
| `test1/` | Criteria on single cases (the module is entirely commented out, kept as a reference) |
| `test2/` | Every criterion type in `AgentEvaluator` |
| `test3/` | `UserSimulator`, `BatchSimulator` and `SimulationGoalsCriterion` |
| `test4/` | `QuickEval`, `EvalSetBuilder`, presets and reporters |
| `test5/` | `evaluate_case`, `evaluate`, rubrics, presets and `EvaluationRunner` |

## Run the example

The tests call a live Gemini model, so install the Google extra and set an API key first. Each test module calls `pytest.skip` at import time so a root pytest run stays offline; delete that call in the module you want to run.

```bash
# From the agentflow/ directory of the repo
pip install "10xgraph[google-genai]"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key"   # GOOGLE_API_KEY also works

# After removing the module-level pytest.skip in test4
pytest examples/evaluation/test4/ -v -s
```

The tests use relative imports (`from ..test_graph import ...`), so run pytest from the `agentflow/` directory rather than from inside the example folder.

## The weather agent under test

The shared graph has one model node and one tool node, wired with the usual tool loop. Two plain Python functions are the tools, and `create_app_and_collector()` compiles the graph with a trajectory collector so evaluators can see which tools ran.

```python
# examples/evaluation/test_graph/__init__.py (condensed)
from tenxgraph.core.graph import Agent, StateGraph, ToolNode
from tenxgraph.core.state import AgentState
from tenxgraph.qa.evaluation.testing import create_eval_app
from tenxgraph.utils.constants import END


def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the current weather for a location."""
    return f"The weather in {location} is sunny"


def get_forecast(location: str, days: int = 3) -> str:
    """Get a multi-day weather forecast for a location."""
    return f"{days}-day forecast for {location}: sunny, cloudy, sunny"


agent = Agent(
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    provider="google",
    system_prompt=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful weather assistant."}],
    tool_node="TOOL",
)


def should_use_tools(state: AgentState) -> str:
    last = state.context[-1] if state.context else None
    if last is None:
        return "TOOL"
    if getattr(last, "tools_calls", None) and last.role == "assistant":
        return "TOOL"
    if last.role == "tool":
        return "MAIN"
    return END


graph = StateGraph()
graph.add_node("MAIN", agent)
graph.add_node("TOOL", ToolNode([get_weather, get_forecast]))
graph.add_conditional_edges("MAIN", should_use_tools, {"TOOL": "TOOL", END: END})
graph.add_edge("TOOL", "MAIN")
graph.set_entry_point("MAIN")

# Returns (compiled_graph, collector)
compiled_graph, collector = create_eval_app(graph)
```

The example file uses a fuller system prompt and builds the graph inside a function; the structure is the same. Each test folder exposes `compiled_graph` and `collector` as session-scoped pytest fixtures in its `conftest.py`.

## Define eval cases and an eval set

Eval cases describe what the agent should do for one input. `samples.py` is the single source of truth, so every test folder reuses the same cases.

```python
# examples/evaluation/samples.py (excerpt)
from tenxgraph.qa.evaluation.dataset import EvalCase, ToolCall
from tenxgraph.qa.evaluation.dataset.eval_set import EvalSet

NYC = EvalCase.single_turn(
    eval_id="nyc_happy",
    name="NYC happy path",
    user_query="Please call the get_weather function for New York City",
    expected_response="The weather in New York City is sunny",
    expected_tools=[ToolCall(name="get_weather")],
)

CAPITAL_QUESTION = EvalCase.single_turn(
    eval_id="capital_no_tool",
    name="General knowledge, no tool",
    user_query="What is the capital of France?",
    expected_response="Paris",
    expected_tools=[],  # empty list asserts zero tool calls
)

EVAL_SET = EvalSet(
    eval_set_id="weather_agent_eval",
    name="Weather Agent Evaluation Suite",
    eval_cases=[NYC, CAPITAL_QUESTION],
)
```

`samples.py` also defines trajectory cases such as `WEATHER_THEN_FORECAST`, whose `expected_tools` list `get_weather` then `get_forecast`. See [Eval sets](/docs/testing/eval-sets) for the full dataset format.

## Get fast feedback with QuickEval

`QuickEval` scores a query without building an eval set or config. Test4 uses `check()` for one query, `batch()` for query and response pairs, `tool_usage()` for tool expectations and `conversation_flow()` for a short multi-turn run.

```python
# examples/evaluation/test4/test_single_turn.py (excerpt)
from tenxgraph.qa.evaluation import QuickEval, assert_eval_passed

report = await QuickEval.check(
    graph=compiled_graph,
    collector=collector,
    query="What is the weather in London?",
    expected_response_contains="sunny",
    expected_tools=["get_weather"],
    threshold=0.5,
    print_results=True,
)
assert_eval_passed(report)  # raises if the pass rate is below 1.0

# Several query and expected-response pairs at once
report = await QuickEval.batch(
    graph=compiled_graph,
    collector=collector,
    test_pairs=[
        ("Weather in NYC?", "The weather in NYC is sunny"),
        ("Capital of Spain?", "The capital of Spain is Madrid"),
    ],
    threshold=0.3,
)
```

Test4 also covers `EvalSetBuilder` with `QuickEval.from_builder()` and `QuickEval.preset()` with `EvalPresets.quick_check()`.

## Score tool usage and trajectories

Trajectory criteria compare the tools the agent actually called against `expected_tools`. Test2 combines the criteria that need no judge model in one config, so a single agent run is scored several ways.

```python
# examples/evaluation/test2/test_weather_agent.py (excerpt)
from tenxgraph.qa.evaluation import AgentEvaluator, CriterionConfig, EvalConfig, MatchType

config = EvalConfig(
    criteria={
        "tool_name_match_score": CriterionConfig.tool_name_match(threshold=1.0),
        "tool_trajectory_avg_score": CriterionConfig.trajectory(
            threshold=1.0,
            match_type=MatchType.EXACT,
        ),
        "rouge_match": CriterionConfig.rouge_match(threshold=0.4),
        "contains_keywords": CriterionConfig.contains_keywords(
            keywords=["New York", "sunny"], threshold=0.5
        ),
    },
    reporter={"enabled": True},
)
evaluator = AgentEvaluator(compiled_graph, collector, config=config)
result = await evaluator.evaluate_case(WEATHER_NYC)
assert result.passed, [c.criterion for c in result.failed_criteria]
```

`MatchType` controls how strict the comparison is.

| Match type | Passes when |
|---|---|
| `EXACT` | The same tools are called with the same arguments and order |
| `IN_ORDER` | Expected tools appear in order, extra calls are allowed |
| `ANY_ORDER` | Expected tools all appear in any order, extra calls are allowed |

The result object carries the pass state, a score per criterion, the actual response, the actual tool calls and the duration. Test5 asserts on each of these fields. See [Criteria](/docs/testing/criteria) for every criterion.

## Simulate a multi-turn user

A simulated user plays a scenario against your agent and a judge scores whether the goals were met. Use it when success depends on the whole conversation rather than one reply. Test3 runs a scenario, attaches `SimulationGoalsCriterion`, and runs several scenarios with `BatchSimulator`.

```python
# examples/evaluation/test3/test_weather_simulator.py (excerpt)
from tenxgraph.qa.evaluation import (
    BatchSimulator,
    ConversationScenario,
    CriterionConfig,
    SimulationGoalsCriterion,
    UserSimulator,
)

scenario = ConversationScenario(
    scenario_id="weather_single_city",
    description="User wants to know the current weather in Tokyo for trip planning",
    starting_prompt="I'm thinking of visiting Tokyo soon. Can you help me?",
    conversation_plan=(
        "1. User hints at travel interest\n"
        "2. User explicitly asks for Tokyo weather\n"
        "3. User confirms they got the information they needed"
    ),
    goals=["Get weather information for Tokyo"],
    max_turns=4,
)

judge = SimulationGoalsCriterion(config=CriterionConfig(enabled=True, threshold=0.5))
simulator = UserSimulator(model="gemini/gemini-2.5-flash", criteria=[judge])

result = await simulator.run(compiled_graph, scenario)
print(result.turns, result.criterion_scores["simulation_goals"])

# Run many scenarios, then summarize
batch = BatchSimulator(simulator=simulator)
results = await batch.run_batch(compiled_graph, [scenario])
print(batch.summary(results))
```

`UserSimulator` makes its own model calls to play the user, so a simulation costs more than a single-turn check. See [User simulation](/docs/testing/user-simulation) for the options.

## Write reports for CI

Reporters turn an evaluation run into files a CI system can store. Test5 and test4 configure `ReporterConfig` and then check which files appear.

```python
# examples/evaluation/test5/test_multi_turn.py (excerpt)
from tenxgraph.qa.evaluation import AgentEvaluator, CriterionConfig, EvalConfig, ReporterConfig

config = EvalConfig(
    criteria={"response_match_score": CriterionConfig.response_match(threshold=0.3)},
    reporter=ReporterConfig(
        enabled=True,
        output_dir="./eval_reports",
        console=False,
        json_report=True,
        html=True,
        junit_xml=True,        # off by default
        timestamp_files=False, # stable filenames for CI artifacts
    ),
)
evaluator = AgentEvaluator(compiled_graph, collector, config=config)
report = await evaluator.evaluate(EVAL_SET)
```

`json_report`, `html` and `console` are on by default; `junit_xml` is off, and `timestamp_files` defaults to `True`. See [Reports](/docs/testing/reports) for the report formats.

## Layer evaluation in CI

Run cheap deterministic checks first and the model-backed ones later, so a broken graph fails fast before you spend on judge or simulator calls.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Unit tests: mocked model, graph logic"]
    B["QuickEval smoke checks"]
    C["AgentEvaluator suites: full criteria"]
    D["Simulation scenarios: multi-turn goals"]
    E["Upload JSON, HTML and JUnit reports"]
    A --> B --> C --> D --> E
```

Use evaluation when you need to know whether the agent called the right tools in the right order, whether the response matches the expected answer, or whether a conversation reached its goals. Do not use it to test deterministic graph structure; [unit tests](/docs/examples/testing) are faster and free of model cost.

## What to try next

- Run the same cases with `EvalPresets.comprehensive(threshold=0.3, use_llm_judge=False)` and compare the criteria count against `EvalPresets.quick_check()`, as test5 does.
- Aggregate several eval sets with `EvaluationRunner`.
- Add a case with `ToolCall` arguments and `CriterionConfig.trajectory(check_args=True)`.
- Run evals from the command line with [Run evals](/docs/testing/run-evals), or inside pytest with [Evals in pytest](/docs/testing/evals-in-pytest).
