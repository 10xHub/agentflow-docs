This section covers 10xGraph as a project rather than as an API: who maintains it, how releases are announced, how to report a security problem, where to ask for help and how to contribute. 10xGraph is MIT licensed and maintained by 10xScale, with Shudipto Trafder as lead maintainer. It is pre-1.0 and was renamed from Agentflow in October 2026, so the pages here matter most to teams deciding whether to depend on it.

## Start here

Read the [Changelog](/changelog) first to see what has shipped and which versions are current, then the [Roadmap](/docs/project/roadmap) for what is missing, partial or deliberately out of scope. The roadmap is where the honest gaps are listed, so it is worth reading before you commit to the project.

If you plan to upgrade across a breaking change, [Upgrade to 1.0](/docs/project/upgrade-to-1.0) explains what to migrate. For the package rename (new PyPI and npm names, CLI and GitHub org), see the launch post [Agentflow is now 10xGraph](/blog/introducing-10xgraph). If something breaks, [Support](/docs/project/support) explains what to collect for a bug report that gets fixed, and [Security](/docs/project/security) describes private vulnerability reporting. To send a fix or a doc improvement, start with [Contributing](/docs/project/contributing); the people involved are listed on [Maintainers](/maintainers).

## At a glance

- **License:** MIT, for the framework, the CLI, and the client. No paid tier and
  no hosted-service requirement.
- **Maintainer:** [10xScale](https://10xscale.ai), which runs 10xGraph in
  production across its own products.
- **Stability:** the 1.0 core API is covered by a deprecation policy. Nothing
  public is removed without a release of warning.
- **Requires:** Python 3.12 or newer; Node 18 or newer for the TypeScript client.
