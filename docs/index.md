AgentFlow is a lightweight, productionâ€‘ready stack for multiâ€‘agent orchestration. It includes:

- AgentFlow (Python library) â€” build agent graphs and workflows
- AgentFlow CLI â€” scaffold, run, and deploy agent APIs
- AgentFlow TypeScript Client â€” consume AgentFlow APIs from web and Node apps

LLMâ€‘agnostic by design: bring OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, local models (Ollama/LM Studio), or anything via LiteLLM or native SDKs.

## ðŸš€ The three building blocks

- Python library: [Agentflow](./Agentflow/index.md)
    - StateGraph orchestration, tools (MCP/Composio/LangChain), streaming, humanâ€‘inâ€‘theâ€‘loop
- CLI: [agentflow CLI](./cli/index.md)
    - Project scaffolding, local dev, Docker/K8s deployment, auth & config
- TypeScript client: [@10xscale/agentflow-client](./client/index.md)
    - Typed APIs for invoke, stream, threads, and memory â€” batteries included

## ï¿½ Why teams choose AgentFlow

- Resilient checkpointing by design
    - Redisâ€‘assisted checkpointing keeps hot paths fast while your primary DB stays lean
    - Purposeful persistence with a 3â€‘layer memory model (working, session, knowledge)
    - No unnecessary data saved â€” you control whatâ€™s stored and when

- Youâ€™re the driver â€” full control knobs
    - Pluggable ID generation and threadâ€‘name generation
    - Callbacks and event hooks everywhere
    - Promptâ€‘injection verification hook before tools run

- Tools that scale from local to distributed
    - Native Python functions with DI
    - MCP servers as firstâ€‘class tools
    - Parallel tool calls out of the box
    - Remote tool calls across services for true microâ€‘orchestration

- Production signals from day one
    - Streaming (delta updates), metrics, usage, and observability
    - Publishers: Console, Redis, Kafka, RabbitMQ

- LLM freedom
    - Use LiteLLM for 100+ models or any native SDK â€” no lockâ€‘in

Like other top frameworks, you also get prebuilt patterns (React, RAG, Router, Swarm, SupervisorTeam, MapReduce, Planâ€‘Actâ€‘Reflect) and a clean DI model â€” but with leaner persistence and stronger operator controls.
