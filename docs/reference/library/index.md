Agentflow is a lightweight yet powerful Python framework designed for building intelligent agents and orchestrating sophisticated multi-agent workflows. Unlike frameworks that lock you into a specific LLM provider, Agentflow is provider-agnostic: bring your favorite LLM SDK—whether it's OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, or any other provider—and Agentflow handles everything else. The framework manages orchestration, state persistence, tool integration, control flow, and streaming, letting you focus on building agent logic rather than plumbing.

## ✨ What you get

Agentflow delivers a comprehensive set of features that cover the entire agent lifecycle, from development to production deployment:

### Core orchestration capabilities

- **LLM-agnostic architecture** — Works seamlessly with any language model provider through a flexible adapter pattern. Use the built-in `Agent` class with `provider` and `model` parameters for unified access to 100+ models, or integrate directly with native SDKs. Your agent logic remains portable across providers.

- **StateGraph-based orchestration** — Define your agent workflows as directed graphs with nodes (processing units) and edges (transitions). Support for conditional routing, dynamic branching, and cyclical flows enables sophisticated agent behaviors.

- **Structured responses** — Parse and validate LLM outputs with built-in support for thinking steps, tool calls, and token usage tracking. Leverage Pydantic models for type-safe state management.

### Tool integration and execution

- **Multi-framework tool support** — Integrate tools from Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, Composio, LangChain, or native Python functions. Each ecosystem is treated as a first-class citizen with dedicated adapters.

- **Parallel execution** — Automatically execute independent tool calls in parallel to reduce latency. The framework handles orchestration, error handling, and result aggregation.

- **Dependency injection** — Clean separation of concerns through DI patterns. Tools and nodes receive state, configuration, and dependencies automatically, making code testable and maintainable.

### State management and persistence

- **Flexible checkpointing** — Choose between InMemory checkpointer for development or production-grade PostgreSQL+Redis checkpointer for high-performance persistence. Redis handles hot path writes while PostgreSQL provides durable storage.

- **Conversation threading** — Maintain multiple independent conversation threads with automatic state isolation. Each thread can be paused, resumed, or branched without affecting others.

- **Incremental state updates** — Only modified state is persisted, reducing storage overhead and improving performance. You control what gets saved and when.

### Real-time interaction and monitoring

- **Streaming responses** — Stream delta updates to clients for real-time user experiences. Support for partial messages, thinking steps, and progressive tool results.

- **Human-in-the-loop workflows** — Pause execution at any point for human review or approval. Resume with modifications, rollback to previous states, or branch into alternative paths.

- **Production observability** — Built-in publishers route events to Console (development), Redis, Kafka, or RabbitMQ (production). Comprehensive metrics track token usage, latency, errors, and custom events.

### Developer experience

- **Type safety** — Full type hints throughout the codebase with mypy validation. Pydantic models ensure runtime type checking for state and configurations.

- **Async-first design** — Native async/await support for efficient I/O operations. Sync wrappers provided for compatibility with synchronous codebases.

- **Extensive documentation** — Comprehensive guides, API references, and runnable examples help you get started quickly and troubleshoot effectively.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Installation

Install Agentflow using uv (recommended for faster dependency resolution):

```bash
uv pip install 10xscale-agentflow
```

Or use traditional pip:

```bash
pip install 10xscale-agentflow
```

### Optional extras

Agentflow supports optional dependencies for specific functionality. Install only what you need to keep your environment lean:

```bash
# Production-grade checkpointing with PostgreSQL and Redis
pip install 10xscale-agentflow[pg_checkpoint]

# Tool integration frameworks
pip install 10xscale-agentflow[mcp]        # Model Context Protocol servers
pip install 10xscale-agentflow[composio]   # Composio tool ecosystem
pip install 10xscale-agentflow[langchain]  # LangChain tools and chains

# Event publishers for production observability
pip install 10xscale-agentflow[redis]      # Redis Streams publisher
pip install 10xscale-agentflow[kafka]      # Apache Kafka publisher
pip install 10xscale-agentflow[rabbitmq]   # RabbitMQ publisher
```

### Configure your LLM provider

Set the API key for your chosen LLM provider. Here's an example using OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

For other providers like Anthropic, Google, or Azure, consult their respective documentation for authentication methods.

## 🧪 Minimal example: React agent with tool calling

This example demonstrates a React (Reason + Act) agent using the **Agent class**—a high-level abstraction that eliminates boilerplate while maintaining full flexibility. The agent decides when to use tools based on the user's query and iterates until it has enough information to provide a complete answer.

```python
from agentflow.checkpointer import InMemoryCheckpointer
from agentflow.graph import Agent, StateGraph, ToolNode
from agentflow.utils import Message


# Define a tool: a simple function that returns weather information
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get current weather for a location."""
    # In production, this would call a real weather API
    return f"Weather in {location}: sunny, 72°F"


# Build the graph with Agent class
graph = StateGraph()

# Add the Agent node - it handles message conversion, tool logic, and LLM calls automatically
graph.add_node("MAIN", Agent(
    model="google/gemini-2.5-flash",
    system_prompt=[{
        "role": "system", 
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant. Use the available tools when needed to provide accurate information."
    }],
    tool_node_name="TOOL"  # Reference the tool node by name
))

# Add the ToolNode - manages tool execution
graph.add_node("TOOL", ToolNode([get_weather]))

# Set the entry point for execution
graph.set_entry_point("MAIN")

# Compile the graph with checkpointing for state persistence
app = graph.compile(checkpointer=InMemoryCheckpointer())

# Execute the agent with a user query
res = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [Message.from_text("What's the weather in Tokyo?")]},
    config={"thread_id": "demo"}
)

# Print the conversation history
for m in res["messages"]:
    print(m)
```

### Why use the Agent class?

The **Agent class** simplifies agent development by handling common patterns automatically:

- ✅ **Automatic message conversion** — Converts state context to LLM-compatible format
- ✅ **Intelligent tool handling** — Includes tools when reasoning, excludes them for final responses
- ✅ **Built-in routing logic** — Automatically routes between agent and tool nodes
- ✅ **Streaming support** — Enable with `config={"is_stream": True}`
- ✅ **Context trimming** — Optional token limit management
- ✅ **Tool filtering** — Filter tools by tags for fine-grained control

Compare this 20-line example to the [manual approach](./graph/agent-class.md#comparison-agent-class-vs-custom-functions) which requires 40+ lines of boilerplate for the same functionality.

### Understanding the flow

1. **User query enters the system** — The graph starts at the MAIN node with the user's message.
2. **Agent reasoning** — The Agent class calls the LLM with the query and available tools, deciding to call `get_weather("Tokyo")`.
3. **Tool execution** — The Agent class automatically routes to TOOL node, which executes the weather function.
4. **Agent synthesis** — The Agent class routes back to MAIN, where the LLM formulates a final answer using the weather data.
5. **Completion** — The Agent class detects the final response and ends execution, returning the complete conversation.

This pattern—reason, act, observe, synthesize—forms the foundation of React agents and can be extended to more complex multi-step workflows. The Agent class handles all the orchestration automatically, letting you focus on defining tools and system prompts.

**Want more control?** You can still use [custom node functions](./graph/nodes.md) when you need non-standard LLM interactions or complex preprocessing logic.
