**AgentFlow** helps you build AI agents that think and act. No complex frameworks. No confusing abstractions. Just simple, working code.

Think of it like building with LEGO blocks:
- **Block 1**: Create an agent
- **Block 2**: Give it tasks (tools)
- **Block 3**: Run it!

That's it. You're building multi-agent systems.

## ⏱️ Start Here: 5-Minute Quick Start

### New to agents? Start here:

1. **[What is AgentFlow?](./getting-started/what-is-agentflow.md)** (2 min read)
2. **[Install it](./getting-started/installation.md)** (3 min)
3. **[Build your first agent](./getting-started/hello-world.md)** (5 min)
4. **[Learn the concepts](./getting-started/core-concepts.md)** (5 min)

🎉 **You'll have a working agent in 15 minutes.**

## 🎯 Ready to See It In Action?

This is all the code you need to create an AI agent:

```python
from agentflow.graph import StateGraph, END
from agentflow.state import AgentState, Message
from agentflow.graph.agent_class import Agent
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-key"

# 1. Create workflow
workflow = StateGraph(state_schema=AgentState)

# 2. Add an agent
agent = Agent(model="openai/gpt-4o", system_prompt="You are helpful.")
workflow.add_node("agent", agent)

# 3. Set the flow
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")  
workflow.add_edge("agent", END)

# 4. Run it
app = workflow.compile()
result = app.invoke({"messages": [Message.text_message("Hello!", "user")]})
print(result["messages"][-1].content)
```

**That's a complete agent!** It takes questions, thinks about them, and responds.

## ✨ What Can You Build?

### 🤖 Chatbots
```
User: "What's my order status?"
Agent: Checks database → Responds
```

### 🔍 Code Reviewers
```
User: Uploads code
Agent: Reviews it → Suggests improvements
```

### 📚 Research Assistants
```
User: "Tell me about X"
Agent: Searches web → Reads articles → Summarizes
```

### 🎯 Autonomous Workers
```
Scheduled: "Process emails"
Agent: Reads → Categorizes → Takes action
```

### 🖼️ Image & Document Analysis
```
User: Uploads a photo or PDF
Agent: Analyzes content → Answers questions
```

All with the same simple pattern.
