# AgentFlow

> AgentFlow is a Python framework for building, orchestrating, and managing multi-agent AI systems. Designed for flexibility and scalability, AgentFlow enables developers to create intelligent agents that collaborate, communicate, and solve complex tasks together using LLMs like Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT, Claude, and more.

AgentFlow simplifies AI agent development with an intuitive graph-based workflow system, built-in memory management, powerful tool integration, and comprehensive testing/evaluation utilities. Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex multi-agent system, AgentFlow provides the primitives and patterns you need.
